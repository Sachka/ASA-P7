Kotoshōgiku Kazuhiro

Kotoshōgiku Kazuhiro (born 30 January 1984 as in Yanagawa, Fukuoka, Japan), is a sumo wrestler. He made his professional debut in 2002, reaching the top division in 2005. He has earned seven special prizes in his career and been runner-up in three tournaments. He wrestles for Sadogatake stable. In 2011 he achieved the standard for promotion to the second highest rank of "ōzeki" of winning 33 bouts over three tournaments, and he was formally promoted by the Japan Sumo Association on 28 September. On 24 January 2016 he became the first Japanese-born wrestler in ten years to win a top-division tournament.
Kikutsugi was one of three brothers born to a builder. As a young boy he attended an area sumo exhibition and had his picture taken sitting on the lap of future "yokozuna" Takanohana. This helped encourage him to try out sumo. He transferred to Meitoku Gijuku Junior High School which is well known for its strong sumo program. In 1998, his third year of junior high, he won a national sumo tournament and was named junior high school "yokozuna". He continued sumo Meitoku's high school. In his club, were two Mongolians exchange students, the future sekitori Asasekiryū and future "yokozuna" Asashōryū. Having become known to the owner of Sadogatake for his sumo skills, he joined that stable after graduating from high school.
He fought his first professional bout in January 2002 under the "shikona" of Kotokikutsugi. Rising quickly, he changed his name to Kotoshōgiku in January 2004 before reaching "jūryō" in July 2004 and the top "makuuchi" division in January 2005. He steadily climbed the top division ranks, reaching "maegashira" 1 in July 2006, but a disastrous 3–12 result sent him back to "maegashira" 7. However, two 10–5 results in the following two tournaments saw him rise back up to "maegashira" 1 and earned him his first Technique prize. He produced a strong 9–6 score in the 2007 New Year tournament.
In March 2007 he made his "san'yaku" debut at "sekiwake" rank, the first newcomer to the rank for nine tournaments. He made a poor start to the tournament, losing eight of his first nine bouts, but he showed great strength of character in winning the last six in a row to finish with a 7–8 record and remain in "san'yaku", albeit at the lower rank of "komusubi". Further losing scores in the next two tournaments caused him to slip to "maegashira" 3 by September 2007. However, a 10–5 mark in that tournament returned him to the titled ranks for November, again at "komusubi". In that tournament he defeated "yokozuna" Hakuhō on the opening day and picked up his second Technique prize.
In January 2008 he was amongst the tournament leaders until he injured his right knee on the eighth day in a loss to Hakuhō and had to withdraw. This was the first time in his career that he had missed any tournament bouts. It was initially reported that he would need ten days of rest, but his stablemaster (the former Kotonowaka) indicated that Kotoshōgiku was keen to return to action as soon as possible. He re-entered the tournament from the 12th day, winning three of his four bouts to finish with nine wins.
Kotoshōgiku was promoted back to "sekiwake" for the March 2008 tournament, where he defeated the eventual tournament winner Asashōryū on the 12th day (his second career win over a "yokozuna") to earn the Outstanding Performance award. He maintained his "sekiwake" rank for three tournaments but returned to the "maegashira" ranks after scoring only 6–9 in July 2008. In July 2009 he returned to the "san'yaku" ranks for the first time in six tournaments, at "komusubi", and came through with a winning record. He made "sekiwake" again in September, but fell short with a 6–9 record. He returned to "komusubi" for the January 2010 tournament, following a strong 10–5 performance at the rank of "maegashira" 2 the previous November. However, he had only one win over a "san'yaku" wrestler in this tournament ("ōzeki" Kaiō) and could score only a "make-koshi" 6–9. In July 2010 he returned to the "sekiwake" rank after scoring 9–6 at "komusubi" in May. Despite admitting some involvement with gambling the wake of the scandal surrounding his stablemate Kotomitsuki, it was not deemed serious enough to warrant a suspension. He scored only 5–10 in this tournament.
Returning to "sekiwake" once again in January 2011, he produced double digit wins for the first time in the "san'yaku" ranks, scoring 11–4 and winning his third Technique Prize. Sumo Association official Takanohana indicated that Kotoshōgiku would be considered for "ōzeki" promotion if he won or came close to winning the following tournament in March. However, that tournament was cancelled due to a match-fixing scandal, and in the following May 2011 'technical examination' tournament he finished out of contention on 10–5. Needing to win at least twelve bouts in July to be considered for "ōzeki" promotion, Kotoshogiku seemed on course by Day 11 when he defeated Hakuho for just the second time to move to 9-2. However, he then lost two in a row to rank-and-filers Okinoumi and Wakanosato, dashing any hopes of immediate promotion. He finished the tournament on 11-4 and was awarded his second Outstanding Performance prize.
In the September 2011 tournament Kotoshōgiku put in another strong performance, faltering only against fellow "sekiwake" Kakuryū and "maegashira" Tochiōzan before beating Hakuhō for the second time in a row on Day 13. This put both men on 10-2 and left open the possibility of a playoff for the "yūshō" on the final day. In the event however, Kotoshōgiku lost his last bout to "ōzeki" Baruto while Hakuhō won to clinch his twentieth championship. Nevertheless, Kotoshogiku on 12-3 had achieved the necessary number of 33 wins over the last three tournaments to earn "ōzeki" promotion. Takanohana commented "Beating the "yokozuna" was a big factor. It was close to a unanimous decision by the judging committee to promote him." Kotoshōgiku became the first Japanese wrestler to be promoted to "ōzeki" since his former stablemate Kotomitsuki in 2007. He was also awarded special prizes for Outstanding Performance (his third) and Technique (his fourth). In his debut "ōzeki" tournament he won his first nine matches, although he lost to two fellow "ōzeki" and "yokozuna" Hakuhō and finished on 11-4. He did not win more than ten bouts in a basho over the next year, and had to withdraw from the September 2012 tournament after suffering a knee injury. He was injured again and withdrew early in the November 2013 tournament; after returning he had two mediocre performances followed by a very poor 5-10 in May 2014 and was "kadoban", at risk of losing his "ōzeki" status. In the July 2014 tournament, he responded with his best performance as an "ōzeki", and was tied for the lead going into the final day before losing to Gōeidō and finishing 12-3. This was his first runner-up performance as an "ōzeki" and the third overall in his career. After a mediocre 9-6 in September, he once again fell "kadoban" after a poor 6-9 performance in the November tournament. However, he comfortably held his rank in the opening tournament of 2015. Another 6-9 in May 2015 saw him "kadoban" yet again. In July his record was 5-7 after twelve days but he preserved his rank with three consecutive wins including a last day victory over Terunofuji. September 2015 saw a return to form as he recorded an 11-4 result to tie for third place. In November he started strongly, winning seven of his first eight matches, but then began to struggle and withdrew injured on day 14 to end with an 8-6-1 record.
The January 2016 tournament marked the ten years since Tochiazuma became the last Japanese-born wrestler to win the top-division title. Kotoshōgiku began with ten straight victories (including wins over Kisenosato and Kakuryu) before attempting to take sole possession of the lead against the similarly undefetated Hakuhō on day 11. Kotoshōgiku had won only four of their previous fifty meetings but started aggressively, forced the yokozuna to the edge and won by "oshidashi": Hakuho said of the winner; "He is better than he’s ever been. I thought I had room to work with, but I was on the straw before I knew it". Kotoshōgiku maintained his lead with a win over Harumafuji and said after the contest "I did what I had to do and gave everything I had. I’m getting calmer every passing day. I’ve come through tough times so I’d like to have the mindset to enjoy this. I just have to win a battle with myself". On day 13 his winning run ended as he sustained an upset loss to the "maegashira" Toyonoshima, a long-time friend. A win against Tochiōzan meant that he entered the final day one win in front of Hakuhō and Toyonoshima, and needing a win over Gōeidō to claim the championship. He defeated his opponent by "tsukiotoshi" to win the tournament with a 14-1 record. His parents who were in attendance, reportedly burst into tears whilst fans in his hometown of Yanagawa celebrated after watching his victory on a big screen. Interviewed after the match he said "I’m so happy, I can’t even put it into words. But I’m also thrilled because I’m standing here now thanks to a great number of people who supported me when I struggled and didn’t get the results I wanted". At a press conference on 16 February, he reflected on the ten-year wait for a Japanese winner and remarked that his fellow Japanese wrestlers may lack the will to win that Mongolian wrestlers have shown. "All the Japanese wrestlers want to win championships... but sumo is about winning. Maybe we Japanese are too set in our ways, maybe we lack the greed to win at all costs... We can learn from them."
The head of the Japan Sumo Association's Judging Department, Isegahama-oyakata, has indicated that if he achieves a "high quality championship" in the March Grand Sumo Tournament, he would be recommended for promotion to yokozuna rank. This would make Kotoshōgiku the first Japanese yokozuna to be promoted since Wakanohana Masaru in 1998. In March he began very strongly to win seven of his first eight matches. His hopes of promotion however, disappeared in the second week as he suffered a series of defeat and ended with an 8-7 record.
He is the owner of the Hidenoyama "toshiyori kabu" or elder stock, indicating he intends to stay in sumo as a coach upon his retirement.
Kotoshōgiku announced his engagement in February 2015, revealing that he had proposed the previous October. He credited his fiancée with helping him through his injury in the Kyushu 2013 tournament. Kotoshōgiku had previously announced an engagement in November 2012, but that was broken off three months later. After marrying in the summer of 2015, the wedding reception was held on 30 January 2016, Kotoshogiku's 32nd birthday, and just a week after his first tournament championship. 630 guests, including former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, attended.
Kotoshōgiku is a "yotsu-sumo" specialist, preferring techniques which involve grabbing the opponent's "mawashi" or belt. He favours a right hand outside, left hand inside grip ("hidari-yotsu"). His most common winning technique is a straightforward "yori-kiri" or force out, which he has used in sixty percent of his career victories. His trademark is "gaburi-yori", which involves using his torso to bump his opponent out, aided by his low centre of gravity and momentum. The next most often used technique is "oshi-dashi" or push out. His style is predictable, and not noted as a technician, he seldom employs throwing techniques.

Mobile communications over IP

MoIP, or mobile communications over internet protocol, is the mobilization of peer-to-peer communications including chat and talk using internet protocol via standard mobile communications applications including 3G, GPRS, Wifi as well as Wimax. Unlike mobile VoIP, MoIP is not a VoIP program made accessible from mobile phones or a switchboard application using VoIP in the background. It is rather a native mobile application on users’ handsets and used to conduct talk and chat over the internet connection as its primary channel.
MoIP applications typically work without any proprietary hardware, are enhanced with real-time contact availability (presence) and save the users money by utilizing free WiFi internet access or fixed internet data plans instead of GSM (talk) minutes. They are completely mobile-centric, designed and optimized specifically for mobile-handsets environment rather than the PC.
MoIP is also sometimes used to refer to:

Bolognese Swordsmanship

Bolognese Swordsmanship, also sometimes known as the Dardi school, is a tradition within the Italian school of swordsmanship which is based on the surviving fencing treatises published by several 16th century fencing masters of Bologna, although records indicate that as early as the 14th century several fencing masters were living and teaching in the city: a maestro Rosolino in 1338, a maestro Nerio in 1354, and a maestro Francesco in 1385.
The Dardi school is named after Lippo Bartolomeo Dardi, a professor of mathematics and astronomy at the University of Bologna, who was licensed as a fencing master and founded a fencing school in Bologna in 1415, just a few years after Fiore dei Liberi had completed his "Fior di Battaglia". The Dardi School constituted both the last great medieval Western martial arts tradition as well as the first great Renaissance tradition, embracing both armed and unarmed combat. No manuscript ascribed to Dardi himself survives, although his tradition became the foundation for the work of Antonio Manciolino and Achille Marozzo, both possibly students of famed Bolognese master Guido Antonio de Luca.
The Bolognese masters whose treatises have survived shared a greater consistency of style, terminology and pedagogy with each other than with fencing masters of the period from other parts of Italy, thus justifying their treatment as a single school. The Dardi school focused primarily the single-handed side-sword still used for both cutting and thrusting. The side-sword was used in combination with various defensive weapons, including a shield ("brocchiero", "rotella" or "targa"), a dagger, a gauntlet or a cape. The two-handed sword or "spadone" was also still taught, although losing its prominence. In addition, instruction on fighting with the poleaxe and other polearms was given.
The "Opera Nova" of Antonio Manciolino was apparently first published in the early 1520s, but only a copy of the likely second edition, "newly revised and printed" in 1531, has survived. It was dedicated to Don Luis de Cordoba, the imperial ambassador to Pope Adrian VI from late 1522 to late 1523.
Achille Marozzo's text "Opera Nova dell'arte delle armi" ("New Treatise on the Art of Arms") was published in 1536 in Modena, dedicated to Count Rangoni. Considered the most important work on Italian fencing of the 16th century, it exemplifies techniques about fighting in a judicial duel with all the major weapons of the times and includes a large section on the conventions and rules of the duel.
The "L'Arte della Spada" ("Art of the Sword") treatise by the "Anonimo Bolognese" (anonymous master of Bologna), Manuscripts Ravenna M-345 and M-346, is an early 16th-century fencing manual of the Bolognese school. It is dated to the "very first years of the 1500s" by Rubboli and Cesari (2005), who would like to ascribe it to the master of Manciolino, while other estimates place it closer to 1550.
Angelo Viggiani's "Lo Schermo" was written around 1550 and published posthumously, ca. 1575.
Giovanni dall'Agocchie, "Dell'Arte di Scrimia", 1572. This work is unusually clear, a significant amount of material on the theory of swordsmanship along with many specific descriptions of the fundamentals.

Anthony Annan

Anthony Gildas Kofi Annan (born 21 July 1986 in Accra) is a Ghanaian international footballer currently playing for HJK.
Anthony Annan began playing football with a local colts Super Rainbow Stars in Cape Coast, Ghana. He also played for Cape Coast Venomous Vipers in the Ghanaian Division one league before joined Sekondi Hasaacas in 2003 and later moved to Accra Hearts of oak in 2005. At Accra Hearts of Oak, Annan was regarded as the best young midfielder in Ghana. He combined midfield artistry with some goal scoring skills, and endeared himself to many football fans in Ghana. Anthony Annan joined Accra Hearts of Oak from Sekondi Hasaacas FC in the 2005–06 league season.
He signed for the Norwegian club I.K. Start in January 2007, after a very promising career in Ghana with his local club Accra Hearts of Oak. He quickly established himself as a first team regular during I.K. Start's preseason games, and showed skills both on and off the ball. Unfortunately he was plagued by injury and illness during the first part of the 2007 season, and did not gain trust from then head coach Benny Lennartson in the important final games to avoid relegation.
After Start got relegated during the 2007 season, he joined Stabæk on loan until August 2008. He had been playing well in the heart of midfield as Stabæk went unbeaten in an impressive opening half of the season. Stabæk hinted that they want to buy him from Start, but Start stated that they would have to pay a "European transfer-fee". Instead, Annan claimed that several "big" clubs had approached his agent and that he would leave Norway during the summer.
On 1 August 2008, it was revealed that Annan would be travelling to England for a trial with Blackburn Rovers. After impressing Paul Ince and the Blackburn coaching staff immensely, while on trial, he was sent back to his club to play in one more competitive game where the Blackburn Rovers scouts were to watch and report back on whether or not to complete the signing.
On 31 August 2008, he was presented for the audience on Lerkendal as a Rosenborg player before the match against Vålerenga. Rosenborg paid £1.2 million to get him from Start. (Rosenborg won the game against Vålerenga 2–1). He made his league debut for Rosenborg on 14 September 2008 against Fredrikstad, with the game ending 1–1.
After four years in Norway, Annan left Rosenborg to join FC Schalke 04.
During the winter break of the 2014/15 season Annan signed a contract with German club 1860 Munich. His contracted was not extended after the season.
On 5 February 2016, Annan returned to HJK. His contract is till the end of season 2018.
A Junior and Olympic International for Ghana, Annan received his first senior call up for the national team on 20 March 2007 as a direct injury replacement for Essien for Ghana's FIFA International friendlies against Austria and Brazil in 2007. His first cap came against Brazil on 27 March 2007 at the Råsunda Stadium, Stockholm, Sweden when Ghana lost 0–1. He made his first goal for the national team in the 2–2 draw against Mali 15 November 2009.
He played for Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.
Annan claims to be related to Ghanaian diplomat and former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, although this has been denied by a spokesperson working for Kofi Annan.
Annan's mother, Sophia Sampson, died in Cape Coast on 2 February 2012 after a short illness. This was while he was playing for Ghana in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.

Typhoon Weapon Station

The Typhoon is a type of remote weapon station manufactured by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems of Israel, and it shares similar design principles and common technologies with Samson Remote Controlled Weapon Station (Samson RCWS), a land-based system manufactured by the same developer. Like Samson RCWS, Typhoon is also multi-configurable.
The Typhoon, and its lightweight variant, Mini Typhoon, are used by the Israeli Navy, Indian Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy, the Republic of Singapore Navy and Singapore's Police Coast Guard.
The first Typhoon, the Mk-23, was released in 1997. The weapon is mounted on a stabilized deck mounting which allows it to remain on target as the platform beneath it moves. The stabilizer has an accuracy of 0.25 mrad, allowing it to keep the weapon aimed to within on a target away.
The mounting does not penetrate the platform, making it relatively simple to fit the weapon to ships. Typhoon can use sights attached to the weapon mount or it can receive inputs from an independent Electro-Optical Detector (EOD) or Fire Control Radar (FCR). Using its own sight the Typhoon system can provide firing solutions entirely without outside assistance, allowing it to function fully independently.
The cannon system mounted can be an ATK, Oerlikon, Mauser or Giat model in the 20–30 mm caliber range. Between 160 and 210 rounds are carried on the mounting, depending on the caliber. The mount can traverse 120° to either side and elevate between -12.5° and 40.5°. The weight of a complete system is between without ammunition, depending on the guns and sensors mounted.
By 2006, more than 120 Typhoon systems had been ordered.
Mini Typhoon is a lightweight, remote-controlled weapon station based on the Typhoon. It can be fitted with a .50 caliber machine gun, a 7.62 mm machine gun or a 40 mm grenade launcher, with a magazine of up to 230 rounds. The system has an accuracy rating of 0.5 mrad, weighs between , depending on the weapon fitted, and can be installed without structural penetration of a ship's deck. The mini Typhoon is also mounted on the Protector USV Mk49 Mod0.

White of the Eye (film)

White of the Eye is a 1987 British thriller film directed by Donald Cammell, and stars David Keith and Cathy Moriarty. It was adapted by Cammell and his wife China Kong from the 1983 novel "Mrs. White", written by Margaret Tracy (pseudonym of the brothers Laurence and Andrew Klavan).
A series of murders of rich young women throughout Arizona bears distinctive signatures of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her current boyfriend. Joan is questioned by Mendoza, but does not believe his insinuations that her husband is somehow involved in the murders.
Various flashbacks show Joan's previous relationship to Mike and later explain how it came to be that he abandoned her. The couple met Paul and befriended him. At Mike's suggestion, he and Mike go on a deer hunting trip together. Paul shoots a deer and brutally mutilates it, demonstrating his sick fascination with killing. This is partly intended to scare Mike off, which it does. Mike catches Joan and Paul after they've made love, and Paul declares that he will take Mike's place. "I am the one," Paul says. Mike puts his gun at the back of Paul's head but decides not to kill and abandons Joan.
By now Joan has run into Mike DeSantos working at a gas station in a neighboring town. Mike tells her he got out of prison after suffering a major head injury and he thinks life is looking up. He makes her promise not to tell Paul that she has seen him. Joan soon discovers Paul has committed adultery. By puncturing Paul's tires she provides him with an alibi for the most recent killing. He begs her forgiveness as the police turn their suspicions away from him. At home, Joan looks into a crawl space in the house, and discovers preserved body parts of Paul's victims wrapped in paper and plastic. Joan confronts Paul, and Paul tries to explain his motivations for killing. He believes he has been "chosen" and is expressing the nothingness of the universe, whose heart is female and destructive like a black hole. He is putting women "out of their misery," but he loves Joan.
Joan's distrust of Paul over the next night and day agitates him into a fury. First, he tries to imprison her and then kill her and his daughter. He heavily arms himself and paints his face to look like a samurai warrior or an Indian brave. Joan and the little girl escape in different directions and soon Joan has to elude Paul in the abandoned quarry. It turns out Mike has been staying there, armed with a machine gun, certain that he will meet Paul again. He rescues Joan and takes away Paul's gun, leading him to the edge of the quarry. Paul makes the sound he uses in the emptiness of living rooms and savors its echo from the quarry. While incessantly pontificating about his philosophies of life and death, Paul reveals a lighter with which he has lit the fuse of his explosive vest. Mike opens fire on him with a machine gun and Joan dives into the lake in the quarry. Paul and Mike both die instantly, in a hail of destruction. Joan is reunited later with her daughter. She talks with Detective Mendoza about what the ten years with Paul could have meant, whose destructive and nihilistic nature she never understood.
The soundtrack album for "White of the Eye" features Rick Fenn and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason.

Galvarino Apablaza

Galvarino Sergio Apablaza Guerra (born November 9, 1950 in Santiago), nicknamed "Comandante Salvador", is a Chilean Marxist guerrilla and former member of the Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front (FPMR) (), which opposed the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. He has participated in several highly publicized kidnappings and murders.
Son of Galvarino Apablaza Orrego and Luisa Guerra Urrutia. He was the leader of the Marxist group FPMR, founded in 1983 as the armed wing of the Communist Party of Chile (PCCh). Its mission was to carry out guerrilla attacks against the Chilean military government of Augusto Pinochet. It is named after Manuel Rodriguez, considered a hero in the war of the independence of Chile against Spain.
After the fall of Pinochet's government and the return to democracy in 1989, the organization broke up into two factions: the FPMR Party, which gave up the armed fight, and the FPMR-Dissidents, which continued terrorist activities. Some of the FPMR most recent attacks include the explosion of a building in which the American company Flour Daniel has offices (August 1994), an attempted bombing of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Santiago (September 1993), an explosion near the Chinese Embassy in Santiago (May 1993), and a bombing of a meetinghouse of the LDS Church in Santiago (December 1992).
Apablaza participated in the kidnapping of the Brazilian advertising executive Washington Olivetto in 2001, according to Brazilian police authorities.
He has been charged by the Chilean judge Hugo Dolmestch for the following crimes: the kidnapping of Cristian Edwards (son of Agustín Edwards Eastman, owner of the newspaper "El Mercurio") and the assassination of Senator Jaime Guzmán.
Galvarino Apablaza was arrested on November 29, 2004 in Argentina. Chilean authorities requested his expulsion so he could be tried in Chile. He immediately asked for political asylum with the support of several human rights organizations, but his situation is still unclear. The Argentine supreme court originally approved his extradition to Chile during September 2010.1
On September 30, 2010 the government of Argentina granted Apablaza political asylum following a meeting of Conare, the National Commission for Refugees.
Apablaza is married to Paula Chain, who happens to be a member of President Cristina Kirchner press relations office at Government House (Casa Rosada) and usually accompanies the Argentine president whenever she travels overseas, the most recent trip was to Germany.

Saeed al-Masri

Mustafa Ahmed Muhammad Uthman Abu al-Yazid (مصطفى أحمد محمد عثمان أبو اليزيد), better known as Saeed al-Masri (سعيد المصري) or simply al-Masri (المصري = the Egyptian), (December 17, 1955 – May 21, 2010) was an Egyptian who was alleged to have acted as the financial chief for al-Qaeda. Along with Mahfouz Ould al-Walid and Saif al-Adel, al-Masri was believed to have opposed the September 11 attacks two months prior to their execution. He was killed in a targeted killing drone airstrike in Pakistan on May 21, 2010.
He was initially arrested among hundreds of others following the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981. He was imprisoned for three years in Egypt, and shortly after he joined Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and in 1988 went to Afghanistan. He had two wives and several sons and daughters, including one married to the son of Sheikh Omar Abd al-Rahman.
As of 1991, al-Masri was working as the financial chief for al-Qaeda, running the "Mektabh al-Muhassiba" (accounting office) in Peshawar. He was alleged to have appointed Ibrahim al-Qosi as his deputy to handle money destined for NGO projects.
al-Masri set up a financial office on McNimr Street in Khartoum on June 9, 1993, from where he managed al-Qaeda's payroll. al-Fadl aided al-Masri until he was replaced by Abu Dijana al-Yemeni and Abdallah Lubnani.
After receiving his pilot license, L'Houssaine Kherchtou returned to the Sudan in December 1995, but was appalled to find that his wife, heavily pregnant and in need of $500 for a cesarean section, was begging on the streets for money to allow her entrance to Khartoum's general hospital. Kherchtou went to al-Masri and asked him to cover his wife's medical bills, and was upset upon being informed there was no money to spare and al-Masri suggested he take her to a Muslim charitable hospital for free treatment. He angrily demanded to know "if it was your wife or your daughter, you would take her there", and later recounted that he was angry enough to have shot al-Masri if he had had a gun at the time.
In May 2007, al-Masri released a video promising Americans that al-Qaeda troops had been training through the winter and were ready to begin a fresh summer offensive in Afghanistan.
In December, al-Masri was said to have claimed responsibility for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, telling Adnkronos International that "we terminated the most precious American asset which vowed to defeat mujahideen". The Asia Times Online also reported that it had received a claim of responsibility from al-Masri by telephone.
al-Masri allowed himself to be interviewed on Geo Television in July 2008 following the Danish embassy bombing, which he claimed were carried out by a Saudi follower of al-Qaeda.
Pakistan's DAWN reported him killed on August 13, 2008 in an airstrike in Bajaur. Tehrik-i-Taliban spokesman Maulvi Omar, himself captured five days after the attack, denied the claim that al-Masri had been killed. Others suggested that the report of his death was a Pakistani attempt to refute recent American accusations that sections of the ISI were still assisting al-Qaeda.
On February 9, 2009 the Indian government received a video from al-Yazid in which he reiterated the promise of Pakistani retaliation if India launched a first strike. This video took everyone by surprise as he was presumed to be dead.
He was reported as having been killed in a US drone attack in Pakistan on May 21, 2010 along with his wife, three daughters and granddaughter. His death was confirmed by US officials and al-Qaeda.

"Crazy Crazy Nights" is a song by the American hard rock band Kiss. It was originally released on the outfit's 1987 album "Crazy Nights".
The song was a regular staple at the group's concerts, up until Eric Carr's passing in November 1991. However, due to constant requests from fans, the song returned to the set-list on the 2010 Sonic Boom Over Europe Tour.
The single peaked at number 65 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 singles chart in the United States on 31 October 1987, and at number 37 on "Billboard"'s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. "Crazy Crazy Nights" was more commercially successful in the United Kingdom, as it peaked at #4, proving to be Kiss' first Top 10 single in the UK.

Sheffield Neepsend by-election, 1950

The Sheffield Neepsend by-election, 1950 was a parliamentary by-election held on 5 April 1950 for the British House of Commons constituency of Sheffield Neepsend in Neepsend, an industrial suburb of the city of Sheffield.
The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Labour Member of Parliament (MP), Harry Morris, was elevated to the peerage as the first Baron Morris of Kenwood. Morris, who had held the seat since its creation for the 1950 general election, had been offered a peerage to trigger a by-election in a safe seat which could be easily won by Frank Soskice.
Soskice had been Solicitor General since Clement Attlee's Labour Government had taken office in 1945. His Birkenhead East constituency had been abolished in boundary changes for the 1950 general election, and he had not been selected for another seat.
Soksice won the by-election comfortably, with over 70% of the votes. He represented Sheffield Neepsend until the constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, when he again found himself without a seat. He returned to Parliament the following year at the by-election on 6 July 1956 for the Newport constituency in Monmouthshire.

Postel Abbey

Postel Abbey is a Premonstratensian abbey in the Belgian municipality of Mol in the province of Antwerp.
In 1138 Premonstratensian canons from Floreffe Abbey founded the monastery at Postel as a dependent priory. In 1613 Postel became independent of Floreffe and in 1618 was raised to the status of abbey. In 1797, the abbey was closed, and the canons expelled, in the course of the French Revolution, when French troops invaded the Austrian Netherlands. In 1847, the community here was re-established, after which the abbey buildings were restored in several phases.
From 1943, until the end of World War II, Herman Van Breda hid part of the manuscripts of Edmund Husserl (Husserl Archives) in the abbey.
The abbey church was built in the Rhineland Romanesque style and dates supposedly from the end of the 12th century (1190). The church has since been rebuilt several times, as a result of which the building shows some characteristics of Gothic and Baroque styles. The abbey was surrounded by walls, and partially surrounded by ditches.
Traditionally, Postel abbey produces Postel, the abbey beer. This beer is no longer brewed within the abbey itself but in a commercial brewery in Opwijk. The abbey also produces cheese. Since 1994, the monks have also exploited a botanical garden of medicinal plants, where they cultivate ginseng.

Dallas World Aquarium

The Dallas World Aquarium is a for-profit aquarium and zoo located in the West End Historic District of downtown Dallas, Texas, USA. It aids conservation and education by housing many animals that are threatened or endangered as part of a cooperative breeding program with other zoos around the world. It has been an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums since 1997, and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
The aquarium was opened in October 1992 in an old 1924 warehouse that had been gutted and rebuilt on the inside. In 1997, "The Orinoco - Secrets of the River" opened in an adjacent warehouse that had been similarly gutted and transformed, and the alley between the two buildings became the divide between freshwater and saltwater exhibits. In May 2000, it purchased a vacant lot behind the original warehouse for its first new construction, the Mundo Maya exhibit, which opened in August 2004. In 2015 Ben Crair of the New Republic wrote an exposé exposing the darker side of the zoo.
The upper level of the aquarium is an artificial reproduction of the Orinoco Rainforest. The rainforest is an aviary, with birds such as scarlet ibis and toucans flying freely. While winding their way through the rainforest, visitors see the only public display of three-toed sloths in the United States, plus animals such as electric eels, caecilians, tamarins, poison dart frogs, Orinoco crocodiles, and vampire bats.
The lower level houses aquaria featuring fish, sea anemones, coral, jellyfish, and other sea animals from around the world. The 10 main tanks feature the aquatic life of Japan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, British Columbia, the Bahamas, Fiji, Palau, Southern Australia, Lord Howe Island, and the Solomon Islands. Other tanks on display include a large tank with a tunnel where visitors can observe fish of the continental shelf swimming around them.
The aquarium is also part of a joint initiative between local companies and corporations and the Dallas Public School district. Many of its employees are also full-time students at the School of Business and Management at the Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet High School. This joint venture, as part of a work-study program by the school, emphasizes real-world business techniques and practices to teach the upcoming generation on maintaining and running the day-to-day operations of one of the city's largest and most well-known attractions.

According to the Political Constitution of the Free and Sovereign State of Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave, the Executive Power is invested in one individual, called "Constitutional Governor of the Free and Sovereign State of Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave". The current governor is Javier Duarte de Ochoa, who assumed the position on December 1, 2010. He is a member of the Revolutionary Institutional Party.
Governors are elected to serve for 6 years and they can not hold the title under any circumstance ever again. The Governor takes office on the first day of December of the same electoral year and ends on November 30 six years after.
The State of Veracruz was created on 1824, being one of the original States of the Federation, it has experienced all the Political Systems implemented in Mexico, Federal and Central, thus it has changed its name from "State of" to "Department of" to "State of" again.
The list with all the Governors of the State since 1825 follows.
From 1834 to 1857 there are no popular-elected Governors due to the Santa Anna's centralist Siete Leyes (Seven Laws).

Stelco Tower

Stelco Tower is the second tallest building in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The 26-storey structure (103 metres/338 feet) was completed in 1973. Originally known as "Stelco Tower" and now officially known as the "100 King Street West" building, many Hamiltonians still refer to it as the "Stelco Tower".
The tower was built as the head office of Stelco, Canada's largest steel producer and one of Hamilton's largest employers. The company used the tower to demonstrate the versatility of steel and to showcase its newest development, "Stelcoloy"; a specialised steel alloy designed to slowly rust over time. The rust helps protect the steel from further damage. This process of oxidation accounts for the steel's unique self-colouring nature; the steel was grey-blue when the building was first erected.

Round barn

A round barn is a historic barn design that could be octagonal, polygonal, or circular in plan. Though round barns were not as popular as some other barn designs, their unique shape makes them noticeable. The years from 1880–1920 represent the height of round barn construction. Round barn construction in the United States can be divided into two overlapping eras. The first, the octagonal era, spanned from 1850–1900. The second, the true circular era, spanned from 1889–1936. The overlap meant that round barns of both types, polygonal and circular, were built during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Numerous round barns in the United States are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Round barns date to the 18th and early 19th century. George Washington designed and built a sixteen-sided threshing barn at his Dogue Run Farm in Fairfax County, Virginia in 1793. It is considered the first American round barn. Early round barns were particularly associated with the Shaker community, one was constructed in 1826 at the Shaker community in Hancock, Massachusetts. A few other round barns appeared on the American landscape before the Civil War.
Despite considerable publicity of the 1826 Shaker barn, the design did not become popular until the 1880s, when some agricultural colleges began to push the design as they taught progressive farming methods, based on the principles of industrial efficiency. It was between 1880–1920 that round barns were most popular in the United States, especially in the Midwest.
The rise in popularity and the promotion of round barns occurred surrounding the new focus on efficiency. The circular shape has a greater volume-to-surface ratio than a square barn. Regardless of size, this made round barns cheaper to construct than similar-sized square or rectangular barns because they required less materials. The structural stability is also enhanced over that of a typical quadrilaterally shaped barn. Simplified construction lacking elaborate truss systems for the arched roof was also seen as an advantage. In the Midwest, particularly, the buildings were thought more resilient against prairie thunderstorms. The interior layout of round barns was promoted as more efficient, since farmers could work in a continuous direction. In the days before mechanization, labor-saving features were a big selling point.
The interest in round barns spread to California in the later 19th century and several were built there. Santa Rosa, California is home to two well-preserved and well-known round barns. One, the Fountaingrove Round Barn, is located on land that was part of the Fountain Grove spiritual commune, the Brotherhood of New Life, founded by Thomas Lake Harris around 1875. Built near the end of the 19th century, it was part of the Fountaingrove winery owned by Harris's protégé, Kanawe Nagasawa, who reportedly designed the structure. Another survivor is the De Turk Round Barn on Donahue Street, and was built in the late 1870s by local settler and businessman Isaac De Turk.
Claims of round barn efficiency were overstated. The round barn never caught on as a standard barn, as some of those pushing the progressive, efficiency-based agricultural methods had hoped. The spread of machinery, especially with the Rural Electrification program, eliminated the advantages of labor-saving designs that were more complicated to build, and the popularity of round barns faded. Regardless, numerous round barns were constructed during the period of popularity the design enjoyed, and a large number still stand today.
The "Octagonal Era" of round barn design stretched from about 1850 until 1900. Round barns, such as Washington's, were often multi sided in their earliest incarnations. Multi-sided round barns came in a variety of polygonal shapes, including layouts of six, eight, nine, ten, twelve, fourteen and sixteen sides. Polygonal barns constructed before the advent of balloon framing tended to have interior spaces that were more rectangular than circular.
The "True Circular Era" of round barn construction spanned from 1889–1936, overlapping the octagonal era and finally dwindling out as round barns fell out of popularity. True circular round barns began to rise as improvements in construction techniques made their design more practical. As balloon framing, circular silos and truly self-supporting roofs were developed, circular barns superseded polygonal structures and began to be built in greater number. Despite the gains in popularity for circular barns, polygonal barns continued to be built up through the height of the True Circular Era.
By the 1920s round barn construction had begun to decline in some locations. In Illinois, the popularity of round barns was in part due to the University of Illinois round barns, and round barn construction had tapered off considerably. Several reasons have been given for the decline in the popularity of round barn designs. The standardization of the construction industry and the resulting decline in timber framing following the American Civil War is one possible reason. Another possibility is that the mechanization of American agriculture was more suited to rectangular barn design.
Designed in a distinctive circular shape, many of these barns were meant to take advantage of gravity to move hay from the loft to the cow stable below. In many cases, a silo was constructed to rise up through the round barn's center. The round barn was promoted as a labor-saving design by agricultural colleges as a progressive way to house dairy cattle.
In the case of the Pete French Round Barn near Frenchglen, Oregon, the barn was built with a rock wall around an inner stable area, and included a covered run around the wall where horses could be exercised during the harsh high desert winters.
The earliest round barns tend to have several flat sides, usually twelve or sixteen. They also tend to be wood-sided while the later round barns are more often faced with brick or glazed tile. The interior design of round barns shifted as well. The early round barns had cattle stanchions on the first floor with the whole of the loft used for hay and feed storage. Later barns possessed a central space which rose up from the ground level through the entire building. The cattle stanchions in this variation of round barn were arranged around a circular manger on the lower level. Above the stanchion level a circular wagon drive allowed hay to be unloaded into the central mow as the wagon circled the perimeter. The final stage of interior design in round barns included a storage silo through the center of the structures. These were not really added until silos became fixtures of American farms. Sometimes the central silo would project up through the roof.
It is known that prominent agricultural colleges began to promote the design technique as round barns came to prominence. However, the provider of the initial impetus is the subject of some debate. In 1848 Orson Fowler published "A Home For All: Of the Gravel Wall and Octagon Mode of Building," extolling the virtues of the octagonal shape in home construction. The book included a discussion on use of the shape in barns and other outbuildings. The book generated a flurry of octagonal home construction, especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states. Some researchers have linked the earliest round barn constructions with Fowler's popular book because so many of the early round barns assumed the octagonal shape.
Other historians discount Fowler's influence on the beginning of the round barn era in the United States. Soike asserts that Fowler did not have any direct connection with any octagonal round barns. He noted that the octagon had ceased to be the basis for building constructions by the Civil War. In Indiana, for example, 219 round barns were constructed between 1850 and 1936; of those, 67 were polygonal, including 17 eight-sided barns built after 1900.
An old belief that the barns were round to keep the devil from hiding in the corners may have helped drive the popularity of round barn construction.
In the Midwest, especially in Illinois, the round barns at the University of Illinois led to an increase in the style's popularity statewide. This was partly due to the U of I's Agricultural Experiment Station's publishing regular "Bulletins". The "Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin" coupled with an article by H.C. Crouch touting round barns in the "Illinois Agriculturalist" led to the construction of round barns across the state. Anecdotal evidence of the impact of the University of Illinois round barns can be collected from farmers today. Stories about fathers and grandfathers recollect round barns being constructed on account of what was going on "over at the University".
Rochester, Indiana, county seat of Fulton County, hosts the annual Round Barn Festival in early June to assert Fulton County's status as the "Round Barn Capital of the World". The city also houses the Round Barn Golf Club at Mill Creek, whose clubhouse is in the renovated Gerig Round Barn.
There are about 20 surviving historic round barns in Canada. The United States has several hundred. In Europe, round barns are common, but there are some notable ones much older than those in North America.

Rouen Cathedral (Monet series)

The Rouen Cathedral series was painted in the 1890s by French impressionist Claude Monet. The paintings in the series each capture the façade of the Rouen Cathedral at different times of the day and year, and reflect changes in its appearance under different lighting conditions.
The "Rouen Cathedral" paintings, more than thirty in all, were made in 1892 and 1893, then reworked in Monet’s studio in 1894. Monet rented spaces across the street from the cathedral, where he set up temporary studios for the purpose. In 1895, he selected what he considered to be the twenty best paintings from the series for display at his Paris dealer’s gallery, and of these he sold eight before the exhibition was over. Pissarro and Cézanne visited the exhibition and praised the series highly.
Historically, the series was well-timed. In the early 1890s, France was seeing a revival of interest in Catholicism and the subject was well received. Apart from its religious significance, Rouen Cathedral–built in the Gothic style–represented all that was best in French history and culture, being a style of architecture that was admired and adopted by many European countries during the Middle Ages.
When Monet painted the "Rouen Cathedral" series, he had long since been impressed with the way light imparts to a subject a distinctly different character at different times of the day and the year, and as atmospheric conditions change. For Monet, the effects of light on a subject became as important as the subject itself. His "Series Paintings", in which he painted many views of the same subject under different lighting conditions, are an attempt to illustrate the importance of light in our perception of a subject at a given time and place.
Robert Pelfrey, in "Art and Mass Media" (Kendall/Hunt, 1996), says:
The cathedral series was not Monet's first series of paintings of a single subject, but it was his most exhaustive. The subject matter was a change, however, for prior to this series, Monet had painted mostly landscapes. The cathedral allowed him to highlight the paradox between a seemingly permanent, solid structure and the ever-changing light which constantly plays with our perception of it. There were calls for the state to buy the entire series and exhibit them as a whole, but these calls were not heeded and the series was divided.
Painting the cathedral was a challenging task, even for Monet. Michael Howard, in his "Encyclopedia of Impressionism" (Carlton, 1997), writes:
Monet found that the thing he had set out to paint–light–was, because of its ever-changing nature and its extreme subtlety, an almost impossible thing to capture. He was assisted, however, by his ability to capture the essence of a scene quickly, then finish it later using a sketch combined with his memory of the scene. For these paintings, he used thick layers of richly textured paint, expressive of the intricate nature of the subject. Paul Hayes Tucker, in "Claude Monet: Life and Art" (Yale University Press, 1995), writes:
The subtle interweaving of colors, the keen perception of the artist and the use of texture all serve to create a series of shimmering images in light and color–masterpieces worthy of the grandeur of their subject matter.

Equivalent dumping coefficient

An equivalent dumping coefficient is a mathematical coefficient used in the calculation of the energy dispersed when a structure moves. As a civil engineering term, it defines the "percent of a cycle of oscillation that is absorbed (converted to heat by friction)" for the structure or sub-structure under analysis. Usually it is assumed that the equivalent dumping coefficient is linear, which is to say invariant compare to oscillatory amplitude. Modern seismic studies have shown this not to be a satisfactory assumption for larger civic structures, and have developed sophisticated amplitude and frequency based functions for "equivalent dumping coefficient".
When a building moves, the materials it is made from absorb a fraction of the kinetic energy (this is especially true of concrete) due primarily to friction and to viscous or elastomeric resistance which convert motion or kinetic energy to heat.

Andrew Walker (barrister)

Andrew Walker (born 1968) is an English barrister and coroner for Northern District of Greater London.
In June 2006 he was appointed on temporary contract as assistant deputy coroner in Oxfordshire, one of three temporary appointees to assist in reducing a backlog of inquests into the deaths of British military personnel overseas.
Bodies of those servicemen dying overseas are repatriated to the UK via RAF Brize Norton leading to the responsibility for inquests being under the civilian jurisdiction of the Oxfordshire coroner.
Statements made by Walker in a number of high-profile cases have been quoted in the British media. He has sought to summon several high-profile witnesses, including Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon, and has been critical of the policy of the position of the government of the United States in that US servicemen do not attend non-US courts, written statements being normally provided.
He has been particularly critical of the actions of the UK Ministry of Defence and United States Department of Defense, particularly with regard to so-called friendly fire incidents. In the case of the death of ITN reporter Terry Lloyd, killed by U.S. forces in southern Iraq in March 2003, Walker recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, the strongest possible judgement in an inquest, calling for the Attorney general and Director of Public Prosecutions to consider criminal charges against the U.S. servicemen involved.
The inquest into the death of British non-commissioned officer, Lance-Corporal of Horse Matty Hull, in a friendly fire incident in 2003 led to significant media interest over the refusal of the US government to release a classified cockpit video recording. The video was leaked to the British media. Walker returned a narrative verdict, stating that the killing of Hull was unlawful. He said: "The attack on the convoy amounted to an assault. It was unlawful because there was no lawful reason for it and in that respect it was criminal."
In the case of the crash of an RAF Nimrod in Afghanistan in 2006, in which 14 servicemen were killed, Walker stated that the evidence heard at the inquest revealed that the entire Nimrod fleet had "never been airworthy from the first time it was released to service".
In August 2007, Andrew Walker as deputy coroner sitting at Hornsey North London, ruled that a full inquest into the police killing of Azelle Rodney could not be held due to the large number of redactions in police officers' evidence statements. The redactions were made under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act which covers information obtained from covert surveillance including telephone taps and bugs.
At a pre-inquest hearing in June 2012 into the police killing of Mark Duggan, Walker said it was "quite extraordinary" that the Independent Police Complaints Commission refused to provide witness statements. He ordered the material to be disclosed within 28 days.

Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)

The Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), also known as Treaty of Ili, was the treaty between the Russian Empire and the Qing dynasty, signed in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on 12 (24) February 1881. It provided for the return to China of the eastern part of the Ili Basin region, also known as Zhetysu occupied by Russia in 1871 during the Dungan Revolt up to 1881.
In 1871, as the Chinese imperial authority in Xinjiang had collapsed due to the Dungan Revolt, Russia occupied the Ili Basin region. Chinese authority in Xinjiang was reestablished by 1877.
In 1879, the Treaty of Livadia was proposed by the Russian court, that would have allowed Russia to retain a strong presence in the region. Qing court refused to sign the Treaty, and in 1880, sent to Russia its Ambassador in Great Britain and Paris, Minister Zeng Jize, renowned as beacon of Chinese diplomacy of the era, to negotiate for more favorable conditions.
The Russian side was represented by Nicholas de Giers, head of Asiatic Affairs department of Foreign Ministry (who later in 1882 ascended to the Minister's seat), and Eugene Bützow, Russia's Ambassador in China.
According to the treaty (Article 1), Russia agreed to return most of the occupied area to China. The Chinese government agreed (Article 2) to hold the residents of the area, regardless of their ethnicity and religion, harmless for their actions during the rebellion. The residents of the area would be allowed (Article 3) to stay or to move to Russian Empire; they would be asked about their choice before the withdrawal of the Russian troops.
Under Article 6 of the treaty, Chinese government would pay Russia 9,000,000 "metal rubles" (; ; probably, silver roubles are meant) to serve as a payment for the occupation costs, compensation for the claims of Russian subjects who lost their property during the rebellion, and for material assistance to the families of Russian subjects killed during the rebellion.
Article 7 set the new international border in the Ili Valley. The area west of the border was retained by Russia "for the settlement of the region's residents who will choose to become Russian subjects and will have to leave the lands that they have owned" east of the new border.
The treaty also provided (Article 8) for minor adjustments of the border between the two countries in the area east of Lake Zaysan (where today East Kazakhstan Province borders on the northern part of Xinjiang's Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture).
Article 10 of the treaty allowed Russia to expand its consular network in the northwestern parts of the Chinese Empire (Xinjiang, Gansu, and Outer Mongolia). Besides the consulates in Ili City (Kulja), Tarbagatai (Chuguchak, Tacheng), Kashgar and Urga (Ulan Bator) provided for in earlier treaties (see Treaty of Kulja, 1851), Russia would also open consulates in Suzhou (Jiuquan), and Turpan. In Kobdo (Khovd), Uliasutai (Uliastai), Hami (Kumul), Urumqi, and Gucheng (Qitai), Russia would be allowed to establish consulates later on, as demanded by the volume of trade.
Article 12 affirmed the right of duty-free trade for Russian traders in Mongolia and Xinjiang. The treaty also contained various provisions designed to facilitate activities of Russian merchants and to regulate bilateral trade. An appendix to the treaty specified the list of border crossings the two countries were to operate.
The Treaty of Saint Petersburg was perceived as a huge loss and step backward by many in Russia, as Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin and the military, as notable commander Aleksei Brusilov.
Several thousands Dungan (Hui) and Taranchi (Uyghur) families made use of the treaty to move to Russian-controlled territory, i.e. to today's south-eastern Kazakhstan and northern Kyrgyzstan. While some of them soon returned to China, most stayed in Russian domains, and descendents of them have lived in Kazakhstan and Northern Kyrgyzstan ever since.
The border between the two empires set by Article 7 of the treaty remains the border between Kazakhstan and China until this day.
Historians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that "China’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium War, China had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go...In the Arrow War (1856-60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884-85). But the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms."
The Qing dynasty forced Russia to hand over disputed territory in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), in what was widely seen by the west as a diplomatic victory for the Qing. Russia acknowledged that Qing China potentially posed a serious military threat. Mass media in the west during this era portrayed China as a rising military power due to its modernization programs and as a major threat to the western world, invoking fears that China would successfully conquer western colonies like Australia.
The British observer Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger suggested a British-Chinese alliance to check Russian expansion in Central Asia.
During the Ili crisis when Qing China threatened to go to war against Russia over the Russian occupation of Ili, the British officer Charles George Gordon was sent to China by Britain to advise China on military options against Russia should a potential war break out between China and Russia.
The Russians observed the Chinese building up their arsenal of modern weapons during the Ili crisis, the Chinese bought thousands of rifles from Germany. In 1880 massive amounts of military equipment and rifles were shipped via boats to China from Antwerp as China purchased torpedoes, artillery, and 260,260 modern rifles from Europe.
The Russian military observer D. V. Putiatia visited China in 1888 and found that in Northeastern China (Manchuria) along the Chinese-Russian border,the Chinese soldiers were potentially able to become adept at "European tactics" under certain circumstances, and the Chinese soldiers were armed with modern weapons like Krupp artillery, Winchester carbines, and Mauser rifles.
Compared to Russian controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz on the Chinese controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war, that China would defeat Russia.
Russian sinologists, the Russian media, threat of internal rebellion, the pariah status inflicted by the Congress of Berlin, the negative state of the Russian economy all led Russia to concede and negotiate with China in St Petersburg, and return most of Ili to China.

Prince Louis, Count of Trani

Prince "Louis" Maria of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Count of Trani (1 August 1838, Naples – 8 June 1886, Paris) was the eldest son of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and his second wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria.
His maternal grandparents were Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg, Duchess of Teschen. The Duke of Teschen was a son of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. The Duchess of Teschen was a great-granddaughter of Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, himself a daughter of George II of the United Kingdom.
Louis was a younger half-brother of Francis II of the Two Sicilies. He was second-in-line to the throne of the Two Sicilies since the time of his birth.
Their father died on 22 May 1859. Francis became King but had no children yet from his wife Maria Sophie of Bavaria. Louis became his heir presumptive. However the Two Sicilies were conquered by the Expedition of the Thousand under Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1861. Garibaldi served the Kingdom of Sardinia which was in the process of Italian unification.
Louis was still the heir of Francis as head of a deposed Royal House. He retained this position for the rest of his life but predeceased Francis. Francis was eventually succeeded by their younger brother Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta.
On 5 June 1861, Louis married Duchess Mathilde Ludovika in Bavaria, the fourth daughter of Maximilian, Duke in Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria. Two of Mathilde's sisters were Elisabeth of Bavaria, married to the Emperor of Austria, and Marie Sophie of Bavaria, wife of Louis's older half-brother Francis II of the Two Sicilies. The marriage was unsuccessful almost from the start, and while Louis took refuge in alcohol, Mathilde spent most of her life traveling from place to place, often accompanied by her sisters.
Louis and Mathilde had a single daughter:
Louis had one illegitimate son, Charles of Duzzio (1869-1931).
Princess Maria Teresa married Prince Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen on 27 June 1889 and later became the Princess of Hohenzollern when her father-in-law died in 1905. She had two sons and a daughter.
Louis died of heart disease in Paris on 8 June 1886.
Some sources claim that Louis had in fact died in 1878: his mind clouded by alcohol and tortured by the knowledge that his life was ruined, he threw himself into Lake Zug, near Zürich. These sources claim that it would have been scandalous if it had been revealed that the brother-in-law of the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria had committed suicide.

Buddenbrockia plumatellae

Buddenbrokia plumatellae is a worm-like parasite of bryozoans whose taxonomic placement long puzzled biologists. It is now classified as one of the only two myxozoans of class Malacosporea on the basis of both genetic and ultrastructural studies. It was the first multicellular myxozoan identified and its vermiform shape initially gave strong support to the theory that the enigmatic group belongs among the Bilateria. Five years later, this was refuted by a study of fifty genes from this same "worm", which had rarely been even seen since its discovery in 1851. These 50 phylogenetic markers reveal that "Buddenbrockia" is closely related to jellyfish and sea anemones, typical members of a major animal group, the Cnidaria. Because of the fast amino acid replacement rate of the nuclear proteins of "Buddenbrockia", as compared to those of the remaining animals sampled in this study, only the use of a sophisticated tree-building approach ("i.e.", Bayesian inference) allowed to recover its cnidarian evolutionary affinities.
One of the researchers talked about the problems encountered studying its morphology: “It has no mouth, no gut, no brain and no nerve cord. It doesn’t have a left or right side or a top or bottom – we can’t even tell which end is the front!” Because the myxozoans are so different from their nearest relatives, he concluded that “the worm-like body shape evolved at least twice from two completely different kinds of animal.”

Ground stable barn

Ground stable barns are a relatively modern type of barn design found in many places across the United States. Mostly constructed after 1910 when government health regulations associated with the dairy industry were altered forcing changes in barn design.
These gambrel roofed buildings were widely adopted throughout the U.S. Promoted by agricultural college experiment station, these barns had washable concrete floors. Cattle were housed at ground level in steel pipe stanchion. The hay loft above is generally ample due to the gambrel roof, which can be erected with pre fabricated trusses. Small milk houses were usually attached to the main barn building and ventilators topped the roof providing fresh air.

Pype Hayes Hall

Pype Hayes Hall is a former mansion house in the Pype Hayes area of Erdington, Birmingham, England. The hall's grounds now form Pype Hayes Park. It was formerly in the historic county of Warwickshire before being transferred into the new county of the West Midlands, along with the rest of the city, in 1974. It has grade II listed status.
The history of the Manor of Pype is obscure, however it seems that the Manor was part of the dower of Dorothy Arden, daughter and co-heiress of Robert Arden of Berwood (now Castle Vale), on her marriage in about 1625 to Hervey Bagot, second son of Sir Hervey Bagot, 1st Baronet.
Bagot enclosed many acres of land and in about 1630 built the new mansion house and park. He lived in the house for 15 years before being killed at the Battle of Naseby in 1645 as a Royalist Colonel in the Civil War. Members of junior branches of the Bagot family continued to live at the Hall for over 250 years. Later additions to the property include the stable block which bears the date 1762 and the house was much enlarged and improved in the mid 19th century.
The poet Robert Southey (1774–1843) worked at the Hall on his 1833 biography of William Cowper, a friend of the Bagots.
Between 1881 and 1888 the Bagots sold around of the estate to Birmingham Tame and Rea Drainage Board for the creation and expansion of the Minworth Sewage Works. The house was let out to tenants before eventually being sold by the Bagots in 1920 to the City of Birmingham. The City Council adapted the park (Pype Hayes Park) for public recreation and the Hall has since been put to various public social uses.
Pype Hayes was run as a residential children's home from around 1949 to the 1970s. There was a murder of a female nurse which was almost identical to a murder 157 years earlier.
In 2015, the hall and outbuildings were purchased by property developer Gerry Poutney, who announced plans to restore them for use as a 60-bed hotel, spa and swimming pool.

Arappalayam

Arappalayam or Arapalayam (தமிழ்:ஆரப்பாளையம்) is an area in the Madurai district of Tamil Nadu State, India. It is on the south bank of the River Vaigai. Arappalyam comes under the Madurai West constituency. The PIN Code for Arasaradi-Arappalaym is 625016.
Arappalaym was one of the 72 palayams created under Madurai Nayak's rule. In Tamil, "Aaru" means river and "Palayam" means area. As it is situated on the river bank it got the name "Arappalayam" ( "Aatruppalayam").
Arappalyam has a very long history. Arappalyam is mentioned in one of the 64 Thiruvilayaadalgal of lord Siva. Arappalyam is called as "Pittukku Mann sumantha thiruthalam." and also it has Ramarpathan which was called Ramanpettai.
During Madurai Nayak rule (1530 to 1730), it was a palayam having its own local administrative body. In 1857, British built Madurai Railway station to connect Madurai and Trichy via Dindigul. Opening Madura coats made it an industrial township .
Arapalayam is nearly 1 km from Meenakshi Amman Temple, Railway station and central bus stand(periyar). Arapalayam was a busiest industrial area a few years back. "Madura coats" a cotton mill, established here had around 20000+ employees in 3 shifts. But unfortunately now its strength is 500+.
Sundaram BPO, reliance fresh, Mathi theathre, Bus stand, River, Market are few attractions in Arapalayam.
Arappalyam Main Road, Manjal medu, Komas palayam, West Ponnagaram (a total of 10 streets), Ponnagaram Broadway, Cross Road, Puttu Thoppu, Kari Medu, Bus Stand, Mothilal Streets, Total head of: AZHARADI Streets, AA Road, DD Road,JJ Road, Gnanaolivupuram, Meiyappan Street, Harvey Nagar, Sahayamatha Street all comes under Arappalayam.
As per the myth, once, the Pandiya King ordered every household in Madurai to offer one person for putting sand on the banks of the river Vaigai to control flood. An old lady, who sold 'Puttu' (a kind of rice pudding) to make a living, had none whom she can send for the flood control work. Lord Shiva disguised as a youth approached the old lady with a deal. He will do the work for the lady and in return she has to give him 'Puttu' every day and hence the name "Puttukku Mann sumantha thiruthalam" meaning - place (thiruthalam) where Shiva carried (sumantha) sand (mann) for 'Puttu'. The agreement is, she need not give him the 'Puttu' which is in good shape, but only the left-overs. The old lady agreed. But Lord Shiva, with his magical powers, made each of the 'Puttu' she cooked as a shapeless unsellable left-over and ate every thing. And worse, he didn't do any work in the river Vaigai either but he chose to sleep under a tree. The King, who was supervising the work, found the lazy man and beat him at the back with a stick. As per the myth, everyone including the king felt the pain in their back. Then the king came to know that the lazy man is none other than lord Shiva and apologised. Even now, to mark this event, on September 4 of every year, a function is held in the river bank of Arappalayam and 'Puttu' is cooked in every household.
Punitha Valanar Aalayam @ St. Joseph’s Church, Gnanaolivupuram, Madurai is one of the biggest Catholic Parish in Tamil Nadu. 50 years ago the parish began as a small unit, and by the Grace of the Almighty, and under the Patron of our Parish, St. Joseph, today flourishing with Spiritual and Social activity in the heart of the city.

Arch of Claudius (British victory)

The Arch of Claudius was a triumphal arch built in honour of the emperor Claudius's successful invasion of Britain. It is now lost, although its inscription is held at the Capitoline Museums and may be seen .
The arch was dedicated in AD 51, although it was anticipated on the reverse of coins issued in AD 46-47 and AD 49. The coin shows it as surmounted by an equestrian statue between two trophies. It was a conversion of one of the arches of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct where it crossed the Via Flaminia, the main road to the north, just north of the Saepta.
The reconstructed inscription (also found on arches dedicated for the same reason at Boulogne-sur-Mer - Claudius's departure point for Britain - and at Cyzicus) reads:

Wickiana

The Wickiana is recognized as one of the most significant collections of news reports and documents pertaining to current events dating from the 16th century in the form of single-leaf and illustrated broadsheets, pamphlets, prints, handwritten texts and drawings. These time capsules form one of the most important archives pertaining to a particular epoch, namely that of the Reformation in Switzerland. Johann Jakob Wick (1522-1588), after whom the collection is named, was the clergyman at the Predigerkirche and its associated hospital in Zürich from 1552 and then second Archdeacon, and thus also canon, at the Grossmünster in Zürich from 1557. He assembled and arranged contemporary news documents chronologically between 1559 and 1588, also integrating further material from the period approx. 1505 until 1559 into his collection.
Wick’s collection is bound in 24 folio volumes, which were housed in the Grossmünster Stiftsbibliothek after Wick’s death in 1588 and subsequently transferred to the Zürich Stadtbibliothek in 1836. In addition to a vast number of prints from the German-speaking countries, the collection also contains 52 items in other languages. Many of the sheets emanate from the most important centres for printing and book production at that period – Augsburg, Nürnberg and Strassburg.
In pictures and texts, the documents bear witness to contemporary life, reporting on such phenomena as natural occurrences – comets, earthquakes and floods -, physical deformities in animals and humans, sensational crimes and political events of the time. For example, the comet of 1577 is described as “terrible and wondrous” (“schrecklich und wunderbarlich”). The collection can be regarded as manifesting the climate of crisis at a time of religious and political turmoil: Huldrych Zwingli (died 1531) had recently predicted the end of the world. Wick’s collection of documents may have been regarded by him and his contemporaries as harbingers of the Last Judgement.
439 illustrated broadsheets (woodcuts), 429 of which belong to the original collection. 10 were added later. In 1925, these illustrated broadsheets were removed from Johann Jakob Wick’s manuscript volumes and archived separately in the Department of Prints and Drawings of the Zentralbibliothek Zürich (Graphische Sammlung). All the rest of the documents, Wick’s entire collection, are housed in the Department of Manuscripts in the Zentralbibliothek Zürich (Handschriftenabteilung).

Ground–structure interaction

The interaction between soil (ground) and structure consists of an exchange of mutual stress between the structure itself and the foundations ground. This means that the movement of the whole ground-structure system is influenced by the type of ground as well as by the type of structure.
The main types of foundations, based upon several building characteristics, are:
The filing of foundations grounds takes place according to the mechanical properties of the grounds themselves: in Italy, for instance, according to the new earthquake-proof norm – Ordinanza 3274/2003 – you can identify the following categories:
The type of foundations is selected according to the type of ground; for instance, in the case of homogeneous rock formations connected plinths are selected, while in the case of very low quality grounds plates are chosen.
For further information about the various ways of building foundations see foundation (architecture).
Both grounds and structures can be more or less deformable; their combination can or cannot cause the amplification of the seismic effects on the structure.
Ground, in fact, is a filter with respect to all the main seismic waves, as stiffer soil fosters high-frequency seismic waves while less compact soil accommodates lower frequency waves. Therefore, a stiff building, characterized by a high fundamental frequency, suffers amplified damage when built on stiff ground and then subjected to higher frequencies.
For instance, suppose there are two buildings that share the same high stiffness. They stand on two different soil types: the first, stiff and rocky—the second, sandy and deformable. If subjected to the same seismic event, the building on the stiff ground suffers greater damage.
The second interaction effect, tied to mechanical properties of soil, is about the lowering (sinking) of foundations, worsened by the seismic event itself, especially about less compact grounds. This phenomenon is called soil liquefaction.
The methods most used to mitigate the problem of the ground-structure interaction consist of the employment of the before-seen isolation systems and of some ground brace techniques, which are adopted above all on the low-quality ones (categories D and E).
The most diffused techniques are the jet-grouting technique and the pile work technique.
The jet-grouting technique consists of injecting in the subsoil some liquid concrete by means of a drill. When this concrete hardens it forms a sort of column that consolidates the surrounding soil. This process is repeated on all areas of the structure.
The pile work technique consists of using piles, which, once inserted in the ground, support the foundation and the building above, by moving the loads or the weights towards soil layers that are deeper and therefore more compact and movement-resistant.

Jesson's Church of England Primary School

The Jesson's Church of England Primary School (Voluntary Aided) is a Church of England primary school located in Dudley, West Midlands. The present head teacher is Ms. Sarah Lea. It has existed since the 19th century, but the current school building was erected in 1980 on part of the site that was occupied by Park Secondary School until the 1970s.
The school traditionally existed as separate infant and junior schools, but merged to form a single primary school in September 1989.
Jesson’s Church of England Primary School is located in the central Dudley area and is surrounded by Edwardian housing and some light industry. It occupies part of the site once belonging to Park School. School buildings have dominated this area for a good century.
"“In 1885 the area was an expanse of open fields, bordered by Grange Road, (a mere track) to the west and Russell Street to the south. To the North were large grounds that belonged to a large building known as “The Shrubbery”,"
The shrubbery has long gone, but the name Jesson has remained and was appropriately used for the new school which now stands where Park School used to be, maintaining an important historical link with this area of Dudley.
1895 was the year Park (Demonstration) School opened and the O.S Map for 1901 shows the school building dominating what used to be open fields. Terraced housing now encloses the square on three sides with only the Shrubbery site remaining unchanged. To coincide with the establishment of the school, School Street was built to link Grange Road with another new thoroughfare, Nelson Road. Dividing Park Boys School from the girls and infants, another new road, Grange Street, was added.
A field adjacent to the square occupied by the school was needed to meet the increase in population. New housing went hand in hand with the new school and both Alexander Street and Edward Street were built at this time. It is heartening to discover however that the open space the other side of Grange Road to the west of the school site, which was developed into The Grange Recreation Ground between 1885 and 1901, still exists today as Grange Park.
Jesson’s School was founded in August 1856 by the "Will and Foresight" of John Williams Jesson (1767–1855)). Old directories list him as a Boot and Shoe Maker, Cheapside, Dudley. Mr. Jesson died, from bronchitis, aged 75, at Victoria Terrace on 13 March 1855. He was buried in his vault in St. Edmund churchyard on the 20th of the same month. His portrait hangs in the entrance hall of the present school.
Early in his will, only written 10 days before his death, John Williams Jesson named nine trustees to whom he bequeathed £10,000 which was to be invested:
"‘towards supporting and establishing a school in Dudley for the education of boys between the age of seven and fourteen years being children of poor persons who from time to time for the time being shall at the time of their admission of their children upon the foundation of the school to be established under this my will be parishioners of and inhabitants with the Parishes of Dudley and Sedgley or within one mile of the said Parishes.’"
The original Charity School opened on Monday 7 July 1856 in rented premises at nearby Shaver’s End. The boys were to be taught reading, writing and arithmetic; they were clothed and at 14 were placed into apprenticeships or "‘otherwise placed in the world’" – ensuring a suitable position in society.
Over the years the school increased its numbers to forty. By 1880 a more suitable accommodation was purchased at Eve Hill where it continued to flourish for a further twenty eight years as a boys’ Charity School.
In 1902 changes in Education were afoot and Jesson’s became a public elementary school and in 1906 it took in the older children from nearby St. James' School.
In 1908 Regulations, drawn up by the Dudley Educational Foundation, set out the conditions under which boys could become "Free placers" at Grammar School.
As a result of the Hadow Report, Jesson’s became a Junior Mixed School. At the end of 1927, after the Managers of the seven Dudley Voluntary Schools had submitted proposals for the extensions of their schools, it was decided the Jesson Charity School should be adapted:
"‘as a school for children of both sexes’".
Two years later the extensions were seen to be:
"‘such as to amount to the provision of a new school, which on completion would provide accommodation for not more than 198 Junior Mixed Children.’"
During the years 1968 and 1969 there was a great deal of debate regarding the future of Church Schools in Dudley, the outcome of which was to be the substitution of St Thomas’s Voluntary Aided School for a School in the former Park Primary School, to be known as Jesson’s Church of England Voluntary Aided School.
In 1970, following the re-organisation in Central Dudley, Jesson’s was re-established with separate departments - Nursery, Infant (5–7 years) and Junior (7–11 years). In 1972, it became a 5-8 First School and 8-12 Middle School. The oldest year group in the school were taught at the former St James's Church of England school on Salop Street.
Plans for a new school had been discussed throughout the 1970s. The Foundation Trustees, supported by the endowments of St. Thomas’s and St. James’s schools, fulfilled their obligations and financed a new building for the Middle School children, which was opened in September 1980. This saw the St James's site declared redundant and the building converted into a youth centre; it closed in 1989 to be relocated brick by brick to the Black Country Museum.
In September 1989, Jesson’s turned full circle when the first and middle schools amalgamated to form Jesson’s Church of England Primary School. However, the newly formed school was housed in separate buildings. A further change took place a year later when the leaving age across the borough was reduced from 12 to 11.
The Foundation Trustees saw fit to finance an extension to the existing Junior building in order to house the Infant Department. The ‘true’ amalgamation was complete in September 1996, with the coming together of all the Departments on one site.
The nursery and what was the old swimming pool, which housed two Reception classes, was replaced with a brand new Foundation Unit for the education of the nursery and reception children. This building was opened in January 2006. It was later blessed by the Bishop of Worcester.
In February 2014, Jesson's CE Primary School was chosen from a list of sixty schools to star in a video showcasing a day in the life of a Church of England school. The video was sent to every Diocese in the country to coincide with Education Sunday; this is a national day that has been marked every year since 1827 and is traditionally the ninth Sunday before Easter.

Peter Freeman (politician)

Peter Freeman (19 October 1888 – 19 May 1956) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom.
He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Brecon and Radnorshire at the 1929 general election, defeating the Conservative MP Walter D'Arcy Hall by only 187 votes. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, D'Arcy Hall retook the seat with a majority of over 8,000.
Freeman unsuccessfully stood at the 1935 general election in the Newport constituency, losing by 1,545 votes to the Conservative MP Reginald Clarry. When Clarry died in January 1945, Freeman did not contest the by-election on 17 May. However, at the general election in July 1945, he took the seat with a majority of 9,091 votes over Clarry's Conservative successor Ronald McMillan Bell.
Freeman held the seat until his death in 1956 at the age of 67. The resulting Newport by-election, 1956 was won by the Labour candidate Frank Soskice, the former Attorney General.
Newport author Mike Bloxsome has written a biography published by Y Lolfa in 2004 entitled "The Green Casanova: The Life Story of Peter Freeman" that aims to be "entertaining and humourous." (sic)

Arches of Claudius

A list of arches dedicated to or by the Roman emperor Claudius.
One of the arches of the Aqua Virgo, which spanned an ancient street, and was restored in monumental form by Claudius (CIL VI.1252). This arch is still standing, in the court of No. 14 Via del Nazareno (Jord. I.1.472; HJ 457), and is probably referred to by Martial IV.18. as date is 46 A.D.
An arch intended to be erected in honour of Claudius' victories in Germany (Dio LX.8 for victories by his generals over the Cauchi and the Chatti in 41 A.D.) is shown in several of his coins of 41 A.D. (and following years) (Cohen, Nero Drusus 1‑6; Claud. 25‑29, 48; BM Imp. Claud. 2, 36, 95‑103, 121‑123, 187‑191). Whether it was actually erected, and if so, where, is uncertain (BM Imp. p. clii).

Godfrey Baseley

Godfrey Baseley (2 October 1904 – 2 February 1997), was a radio executive, who is most famous as being the creator of the soap opera "The Archers".
Cyril Godfrey Baseley was born at Alvechurch near Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, England. He was educated at Bootham School, York.
Before creating "The Archers", he had previous experience in making over radio programmes about farming, mainly for the Midland region. However, after being inspired by the idea of another radio programme at the time "Dick Barton - Special Agent", he decided to create a farming show with a narrative.
Baseley had tried to write a story, but later threw it away. The story was however saved by his secretary. He then threw it away again, and later engaged for the series two "Dick Barton" writers, Ted Mason and Geoffrey Webb. After telling him some detailed biographies of the characters, Mason and Webb wrote the first "Archers" script. The pilot programme was broadcast to the English Midlands on Whit Monday, 1950, and was first broadcast across the UK on the BBC Home Service network on 1 January 1951.
In the late 1960s Baseley took part in "The Archers" himself as an actor, playing the part of Brigadier Winstanley, although billed in the Radio Times under a pseudonym.
Baseley was replaced as script editor for "The Archers" in 1972. His successor, Malcolm Lynch, had previously worked as a script writer for the television drama series, "Coronation Street". Baseley was not uncritical of some of his successors.
Godfrey Baseley died at Bromsgrove on 2 February 1997

Certain People I Know

"Certain People I Know" was a single by Morrissey released in December 1992. It was the third single to be taken from the "Your Arsenal" album and was the third and final Morrissey single to be produced by glam rock legend Mick Ronson.
Reaching number 35 in the UK Singles Chart, the song had the distinction of being Morrissey's lowest charting solo single up to that point.
The track is in many ways a tribute to the influence of Marc Bolan on both Morrissey and his guitarist Boz Boorer, featuring a guitar line played by producer Mick Ronson that recalls "Ride a White Swan" by T. Rex.
This was also the first Morrissey single to be released following the singer's bottling off stage at the Madstock festival when he supported Madness and the subsequent "NME" story regarding his alleged racism. This led to the single cover being changed from featuring the singer's name spelt out in the colours of the Union Jack to plain black writing.
The video to the track was shot in Chicago.
British 7" and 12": WHY BOTHER TO KEEP CLEAN?/WHY BOTHER TO KEEP CLEAN?
Ned Raggett of AllMusic called the lead track "a bit of an odd choice" for a single but added its b-sides "are among Morrissey's best".
The song was performed live by Morrissey on his 1992 tour.

Armenian Evangelical Martyrs' Church

The Armenian Evangelical Martyrs' Church (Nahadagatz) is located in Soulemaniye quarter, Aleppo, Syria. The origin of the church goes back to 1865, Aintab, Turkey, where the first Armenian Evangelical - Kayajik church with the full content of its members was split into two groups and one group moved into Hayik quarter of the city and established a second church there. The first pastor of the church was Rev. Kara Krikor Haroutyounian, who has served the church until his death in 1907. Rev. Manaseh Papazian has also served as associate pastor from 1892–1907 followed by Rev. Bedros Topalian (1907–1912). During these years, the church had run an elementary and an intermediate school called Niziblian School (founded by the benevolent Mr. Adoor Niziblian). Then several pastors took over the leadership of the church until 1921, when all the Armenians of Aintab were forced out of the city.
The Church's new location – Martyrs' Church, Aleppo.
In 1931 some seventeen members together with their families of the former Hayik Church came together and founded the Nahadagatz (Martyrs') church. The name was chosen to commemorate the Armenian Martyrs' under the Ottoman regime (1914–1918). The first pastor of the church was Rev. Hagop Chakmakjian. The congregation first meet in an ancient courtyard close to the Salibe Christian Quarter, and then they moved to a rented building which was known at that time as the Armenian Red Cross building in Suleymaniye Street. In 1965, the church board decided to buy a lot in Soulemaniye quarter and build its permanent sanctuary with the parsonage. From the time of its founding, the church has played a great role in the formation of the Christian, moral and national character of hundreds of children, teenagers, youth and grown ups who attended its services.
The church is located in Sulemaniye quarter, Aleppo, Syria. The origin of its foundation goes back to 1865, Aintab, Turkey. When the members of the first Armenian Evangelical church of the town (known as Kayajik church) grew in number, the congregation and the serving pastors decided to split into two groups. One of the groups moved to a nearby neighborhood called Hayik and established a separate church there. The first pastor of this new congregation was Rev. Kara-Krikor Harutyunian, who has served the church until he died in 1907 and with whom Rev. Manaseh Papazian has collaterally served as an associate pastor from 1892–1907, followed by Rev. Bedros Topalian (1907–1912). During these years, the church had run an elementary and intermediate Niziblian School (founded by the benevolent Mr. Adoor Niziblian). Then several pastors took over the leadership of the church until 1921, when all the Armenians of Aintab were forced out of the city. Professor Lutfi Levonian was the last preacher of the church in Aintab, Turkey era.
When the Armenians were relocated in Aleppo, the evangelical congregation of the Hayik church started to attend the church services of the newly founded Armenian Evangelical Emmanuel church. Things went this way until 1930 when 33 of the former "Hayik" church families decided to split and reestablish another church. Thus, in 1931 and with the official recognition of the Union of the Armenian Evangelical churches of Near East, the Nahadagatz (Martyrs') church was born.
The name "Nahadagatz" was chosen to commemorate the Armenian Martyrs' who have suffered the atrocities of the Young Turks' regime between the years 1914-1918. The first pastor of the church was Rev. Hagop Chakmakjian. At the beginning, the congregation used to meet in an ancient courtyard close to the Salibe Christian quarter, then in 1936 the church moved to a rented building which was known at that time as the "Armenian Red Cross building" in Sulemaniye neighborhood. In 1960, the church board bought a new lot in Sulemaniye and after securing the necessary funds built its permanent sanctuary, which was officially inaugurated on 14 March 1965.
Dr. Haroutune Nazarian (1907–2002) is always remembered as one of the most committed lay members of the church who implemented his passion, vision, and service for "Nahadagatz" throughout his life.
From the time of its foundation, the church has played a major role in the formation of the Christian, moral and ethnic character of hundreds of Armenian children, teenagers, youth and adults who have attended its services.
Although beginning in the 1980s many of its families left the country and immigrated to the West and the membership of the church diminished, the church still carries on the mission of its founders. Besides the regular Sunday services, the church also runs a Sunday school for children, summer DVBS, CE Youth association, Ladies auxiliary and newlywed families' meetings.
Nahadagatz Church is a member of Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East (UAECNE).

Savudrija

Savudrija () is a coastal settlement in northwestern Istria, Croatia. It has developed from a fishing village into a pleasant holiday centre. Savudrija is also the name of the surrounding area in the peninsula.
The 19th century Savudrija Lighthouse is a distinctive local landmark; it is the oldest in Croatia, and the oldest operational light of the Adriatic. The lighthouse is also the most northerly in Croatia. Three kinds of wind meet here, so the area is popular with windsurfers.
As evidenced by archaeological finds, the Savudrija area has been settled since the Neolithic period. The Roman port facilities still remain intact. In the vicinity of Savudrija are some notable Roman sites, in particular a Roman fort on the peninsula. The village was mentioned in written sources in the second part of the 12th century and was part of the Piran municipality from the 13th century, while today it is part of Istria County in Croatia. On 18 February 1893, Savudrija became part of the Piran municipality.
The territory remained part of the municipality of Piran until 1947, when the municipality of Savudrija was set up. In 1954, when the Free Territory of Trieste was dissolved and its southern part became officially part of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Savudrija was joined to the Socialist Republic of Croatia in accordance with the decisions of ZAVNOH.
According to the last Austrian census in 1910, almost 79% of the population of the Savudrija territory was Italian-speaking, 14% were Slovene-speaking. During the period of Italian rule (1922–1945), the zone was almost completely Italianized. According to the first ethnic census in 1945, Savudrija had a Croatian majority, with 54% Croats, 30% Italians, and 14% Slovenes. Following the decisions of the Paris Peace Treaty (1947), many ethnic Italians opted to relocate to Italy. Today, Savudrija remains largely Croatian-speaking, but there is a small Italian minority, and most topographic signs are bilingual.

Robert Charleton

Robert Charleton (1809–1872) was a Quaker, Recorded Minister and a prominent citizen of Bristol, England. He was a philanthropist and ran a pin-making factory which was noted for its good employment practices. He was an advocate of total abstinence and peaceful relations between nations.
He was the son of James and Elizabeth Charleton of Bristol. James died at Ashley Hill, Bristol, in 1847. After a business training under H. F. Cotterell, a land surveyor at Bath, became the proprietor of a pin manufactory at Kingswood, near Bristol, in 1833, and continued that business until his retirement in 1852. He married, on 13 Dec 1849, Catherine Brewster, the eldest daughter of Thomas Fox of Ipswich. He died at his residence, Ashley Down, near Bristol, on 5 Dec 1872.
Robert Charleton ran one of the largest factories in East Bristol, at Two Mile Hill, Kingswood, from 1831 to 1852. It was inspected by Elijah Waring, the Sub-Commissioner for South Gloucestershire, for the Childrens Employment Commission (1840). The report describes the working condition of the workers, and the outworkers.
In 1841 Robert Charleton employed about 110 women and girls and 50 men and boys in the factory. In addition, about 500 women and girl outworkers were employed at heading and sticking. Pin making is an example of the survival of the pre-industrial system of outwork well into the Victorian years of factory based industrial organisation.
"Pin-making furnishes employment to a multitude of the poor population; the operation of fixing on the heads being carried on to a great extent by females, in private houses as well as in the manufactories".
He reported that the majority of employees in these two factories were young girls from 14–18 years old; no girls or boys under 12 were employed.
A few boys were employed in drawing and straightening the wire. The boys in Charleton's factory were all sons of men working in the factory. Some were employed directly by Charleton, others were paid by their fathers.
The Victorians were concerned that working class single women should be respectable. Girls who went out to work were in moral danger and were not being trained in the skills that they would need to become good mothers. To the emerging middle class, pinmaking was seen as suitable occupation for the poor, and suitable for women. Waring describes approvingly Robert Charletons strict moral control and his disciplined work force.
"The girls employed in pin-heading, are accustomed to take a share in the domestic labours of home; and when they become wives and mothers, are considered to fulfill their relative duties very respectably. It is, nevertheless, hardly probable, that they can be, generally, so well qualified for the economy of housekeeping, as girls who have been either in service, or in constant household training".
Attendance at Sunday School and the ability to read and write were taken as signs of moral respectability.
"The separation between the male and female workpeople, in these pin-manufactories, is perfect; and the proprietors, in both instances, reject any candidates for employment, who cannot bring with them a fair moral character".
Charleton was reported as believing that the women he employed were "respectable", and most of them were "virtuous girls".
He would fine his employees 3d for using foul language, and they were permitted to sing but only hymn tunes.
Robert Charleton built a school for the children of his employees. There was already provision for the education of the poor in the South Gloucester area at national schools, charity schools and Sunday Schools. Two-thirds to three-quarters of the working class was literate in the early 19th century..
Girls and boys paid 2d a week to attend the school and 1d extra for writing. Both boys and girls did reading, writing and grammar. Girls were taught sewing, and the boys geography and maths. The school rooms accommodated 120 boys and 80 girls. The schools at Kingswood and Oldland Common were mainly dependent on his support and superintendence, also the large British school in Redcross Street, Bristol
As a Quaker he wrote a critique of Barclay's Apology(1868). He was present in as a child at Congénies in the 1820s. He was a member of the Peace Society and was part of a peace delegation (1854) with Joseph Sturge and Henry Pease that went to St Petersburg to attempt to head off the Crimea War to present an address to the Emperor Nicholas at St. Petersburg against the war. This address was graciously received by the emperor on 10 Feb (Illust. London News, 4 and 11 March 1854).
Again in 1858, in company with Robert Forster, he presented to the northern powers of Europe the plea for liberty of conscience issued by the Society of Friends. At the commencement of 1860 he was unanimously recorded by the monthly meeting of Bristol »as an approved minister of the Gospel.«
Henceforth his time was chiefly occupied in lecturing throughout England and Ireland. He was an advocate of the Permissive Bill, and much averse to the Contagious Diseases Acts.
He was involved with the temperance movement believing in total abstinence. He was one of the earliest of the advocates of total abstinence. He lectured on that subject in England in 1836, and in 1842 with his friend Samuel Capper in Ireland. At the same time he advocated the doctrines of the Friends, and in 1849 accompanied Capper in his tent-meeting tour in Oxfordshire and the neighbouring counties.

Western Union splice

The Western Union or Lineman splice was developed during the introduction of the telegraph to mechanically and electrically connect wires that were subject to loading stress. The wrapping pattern is designed to cause the termination to tighten as the conductors pull against each other. This type of splice is more suited to solid, rather than stranded conductors, and is fairly difficult to complete.
The Western Union Splice is made by twisting two ends of a wire together counterclockwise 3/4 of a turn each, finger tight. Then, using needle-nose pliers, the ends are twisted at least five more turns, tightly. The cut off ends are pushed close to the center wire.
"Short tie" and "long tie" variations exist, mainly for purposes of coating the connection with solder. The longer version may aid in solder flow.
NASA tests on 22 and 16 AWG wire showed that the Western Union Splice is very strong and is stronger than the wire alone if done properly.

RAF Bridgnorth

RAF Bridgnorth was a Royal Air Force Station, created after the outbreak of the World War II on 6 November 1939, at Stanmore, to the east of Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England. However, as RAF Stanmore Park already existed in Middlesex, it was named RAF Bridgnorth. Although during its existence various static aeroplanes were displayed as Gate Guardians, RAF Bridgnorth never had a runway.
The first unit stationed there was No.4 Recruit Centre. Their role was to carry out the basic training of new recruits in the RAF. In 1940 spare accommodation at Bridgnorth enabled it to be used as a transit and kitting out centre for troops returning from France. In 1941 the Station was renamed No.1 Women's Auxiliary Air Force Depot involved with the training of WAAF recruits. 1942 saw another change of name to the No.1 Elementary Air Navigation School. Other changes subsequently took place as dictated by the needs of the war effort.
Only after the war ended in 1945 could the Station revert to its original task of providing basic training to recruits, as the No.7 School of Recruit Training. It retained that name until closure in 1963. The unit badge carries the motto “This is the gate, the walls are men.”
On Armistice Sunday 6 November 1949, a massed parade of 3,400 men supported the Mayor of Bridgnorth. On 12 April 1950 the Borough of Bridgnorth granted RAF Bridgnorth the Freedom of Entry to the town. It was the first RAF Station to be granted Freedom of Entry in the UK; video of the Freedom of Entry parade seen here, filmed by British Pathé British Pathé Film of " The RAF receive 'Freedom on Entry' of Bridgnorth".
On 7 June 1951, RAF Bridgnorth exercised its right for the first time to march through the town, via the North Gate, with bayonets fixed, drums beating and colours flying. A Lancaster flew overhead. That was only possible after the RAF Service had received the King's Colours on 26 May 1951.
Tens of thousands of recruits passed through Bridgnorth for their initial eight weeks training or ‘square bashing’ as it was called.
The Station closed down on Friday 8 February 1963. A commemorative plaque was unveiled on the former '3' Wing mess hall / cook house chimney on 28 May 1994. The chimney is now in the part of the former RAF Station that has been designated a Country Park.

Wait (White Lion song)

"Wait" is a song recorded by White Lion and written by White Lion vocalist Mike Tramp and guitarist Vito Bratta. It was the lead single from their second album, "Pride".
The single was released on June 1, 1987, but did not chart until February 1988, around the time the band filmed their "Live in New York" concert for MTV. In May 1988, "Wait" finally cracked the top 10 in the US, due in no small part to MTV airing the "Wait" music video in regular rotation—nearly seven months after the single's release. The song peaked at #8 and also charted at #48 in Canada and #88 in the UK.
The song features a music video and was also re-recorded in 1999 on the album "Remembering White Lion" (also released as "Last Roar" in 2004) and a live version was released in 2005 on the live album "Rocking the USA". The live version was released as a promo and later iTunes single and also features as a bonus track on the album "Return of the Pride".

<doc id="9364017" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9364017" title="Bank barn">
Bank barn

A bank barn or banked barn is a style of barn noted for its accessibility, at ground level, on two separate levels. Often built into the side of a hill, or bank, both the upper and the lower floors area could be accessed from ground level, one area at the top of the hill and the other at the bottom. The second level of a bank barn also could be accessed from a ramp if a hill was not available.
Examples of bank barns can be found in the United Kingdom, in the US, in eastern Canada, in Norway, in the Dordogne in France and in Umbria, Italy, amongst other places.
Bank barns are especially common in the upland areas of Britain, in Northumberland and Cumbria in northern England and in Devon in the south-west.
The origins of bank barns in the UK are obscure. The bank barn had made its first appearance in Cumbria by the 1660s on the farms of wealthy farmers: here farmers bought drove cattle from Scotland and fattened them over winter before selling them in spring. The bank barn at Townend Farm, Troutbeck in former Cumberland was built for the prominent Browne family in 1666. The great majority of bank barns were built in Cumbria between 1750 and 1860, and the last were built just before the First World War.
Usually stone built, British bank barns are rectangular buildings. They usually have a central threshing area with hay or corn (cereal) storage bays on either side on the upper floor; and byres, stables, cartshed or other rooms below. The threshing barn on the upper floor was entered by double doors in the long wall approached from a raised bank: these banks could be artificially created. Opposite the main doors was a small winnowing door which opened high above the farmyard level. A common arrangement had an open-fronted single bay cartshed below the threshing floor, with stables on one side and a cow-house on the other. The entrances to these lower floor rooms were protected from above in many cases by a continuous canopy or pentise carried on timber or stone beams which are cantilevered from the main wall. Brick-built bank barns are less common.
In the 1660s, Sir Daniel Fleming of Rydal Hall in the Lake District housed 44 cattle in his long bank barn at Low Park. The cattle faced the side walls and backed on to a central manure passage. In other bank barns in Cumbria the entrances, in the side walls, gave access to a cow-house, stable and cartshed; some 19th-century examples have four-horse stables, root houses (for storage of root crops for fodder) and feeding and dung passages for the cows.
As well as the true bank barns that occur in a small concentration in Devon, a variation on the bank barn is also found in Devon and Cornwall where the upper floor is accessed by external stone steps rather than the hillside or a ramp.
The architectural historian Ronald Brunskill states that, although the British examples are older, the term "bank barn" is an imported term "to describe a type of farm building which is so common in certain parts of Britain that it has developed no descriptive term of its own".
Bank barns were a popular 19th century barn style in the US. These structures were sometimes referred to as "basement barns" because of their exposed basement story. Regionally, this barn style could be known by other names as well, including, in Vermont, Yankee barn, which is a name more often associated with English barns. In New England these barns are known as New England style or Gable-fronted barns.
In the Pennsylvania barn, the upper floor was a hayloft and the lower a stable area. The barn doors were typically on the sidewall. With William Penn's promise of freedom and inexpensive land, many settlers came to Pennsylvania. Among these settlers were the Germans, who began to build bank barns on their land. Many other settlers followed this practice and it was soon the most common type of barn Pennsylvania during the colonial era. The Pennsylvania Barn is a specific type of bank barn with a forebay, a projecting floor on one or more sides of the barn. All forebay barns are bank barns but not all bank barns are forebay barns. Robert F. Ensminger in his classic book "The Pennsylvania barn: its origin, evolution, and distribution in North America" identifies three basic types of Pennsylvania barn: the Sweitzer, Standard, and Extended.
The English Lake District Bank Barn is another type of bank barn found only in Pennsylvania.
The New England barn is from a different tradition than the Pennsylvania Barn. In New England the barn doors are always on the gable end. The cows were on the main level, hay in a mow on the main level and/or above in haylofts, possibly grain storage on the main level, sometimes a tack room or workshop and the basement was used for manure management and other tasks. The New England barn developed in the early 19th century, became the most popular barn type after 1850 replacing the smaller, side-entry English barn and are almost always square rule framing.
Similar barns are also found in upstate New York and westward and Canada.
The design of some bank barns called a "High-Drive Bank Barn" allowed for wagons to enter directly into the hay loft making unloading the hay easier. Sometimes the high-drive was accessed by an earthen or wood ramp and sometimes the ramp was covered like a bridge to make it more durable. In the Pennsylvania Barns the animals were housed in the basement level. In many other bank barns the tie-ups were on the upper-ground level and below the stables a basement usually acted as a manure collection area. Many bank barns simply have a small incline leading up to the loft area as opposed to a ramp. Some bank barns are constructed directly into existing hillsides while others are fitted with built up earthen and stone areas to create the trademark bank. The design is similar to English barns except for bank and basement aspects. The basement space could be utilized for animals while the area above, easily accessed by wagon because of the bank, could be used for feed and grain storage. Bank barns can be thought of as English barns raised up on an exposed full basement.

Millhouse Green

Millhouse Green is a village on the north banks of the River Don on the A628 road west of Penistone in the English county of South Yorkshire.
Administratively, Millhouse Green forms part of the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley and Penistone civil parish. The village falls within the Penistone West Ward of the Barnsley MBC.
Millhouse Green is home to the expected amenities of a village of this size. There is a small Post Office with shop in near the western edge of the village as well as another small shop near the centre. There is also the Millhouse Institute, a village hall which plays host to small events and has a crown green bowling square at the rear. There is also a pub, the Blacksmiths and further out from the centre are Windmill Nurseries and Avid Farm Shop which both have cafes.
Until recently, Millhouse also had a 4x4 dealership which had previously been a petrol station. This was cleared for construction and is now the 'New Estate'.
The village is home to Millhouse Primary School a small, mixed primary school. It has from 80 - 100 students depending on the time of year, due to staggered intake.
A development of around 200 homes was planned for the village, with the building work being split between Cala Homes and another developer. The site was selected as the old factory grounds for Hoyland Fox, an umbrella frame manufacturer and was renamed Springfields. The construction was placed on hiatus owing to the global financial crisis, but was finally completed in 2013.

Langsett

Langsett is a village and civil parish near Penistone in South Yorkshire. It lies near the southern edge of the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley and on the edge of the Peak District National Park. At the 2001 census it had a population of 161, increasing to 222 at the 2011 Census.
In the early Medieval period, Langsett was known as Penisale. It held a royal charter entitling it to hold a weekly market on Tuesdays and an annual three-day fair, but these were held somewhere in the country rather than in the village itself. The market charter was later used to start a market in Penistone.
A tradition associates the location of Penisale market with a cross near the junction of Cross Lane and Hartcliffe Road. This theory is rejected by Neville T. Sharpe, who holds that this was a wayside cross used as a guide by travellers.
In chronostratigraphy, the British sub-stage of the Carboniferous period, the 'Langsettian' derives its name from a study of geological exposures in the banks of the Little Don River near Langsett.

Last Night (Mar-Keys composition)

"Last Night" is an instrumental recorded by The Mar-Keys. Released in 1961, it charted #3 Pop and #2 R&B in the United States. It also appeared on "Last Night!", the first LP released by the Stax label.
Written by Charles Axton, Floyd Newman, Gilbert C. Caple, Jerry Lee Smith, and Chips Moman. The tune was covered by Georgie Fame on his 1966 "Sweet Things" album. It was also covered by the jazz ensemble The Bum Notes for the closing credits of BBC sitcom "Bottom" in the early 1990s, and was used as the backing music to "Viaduct", a game played on the Chris Moyles radio show.
The song is in a 12 bar blues form, with brief stops, where one of the Markeys intones "Last Night" before the Saxophone solo, which is followed by the same Markeys intoning "Oh!!!!!! Yeah!!!" before the last three Choruses, including the pauses, before the song's fade.
According to Steve Cropper, in an interview with Paul Nassari of the Sunday Mail newspaper (Adelaide, Australia), "Jerry Lee ‘Smoochy’ Smith came up with the piano riff that was played on organ. Since [producer Chips] Moman didn’t want a guitar on it for whatever reason, I wound up playing the hold-down on the organ on the root note. "It hurts me in the Mar-Keys history when people say I wasn’t in the Mar-Keys because there’s no guitar on Last Night but I have to differ with them."
During the 1960s, "Last Night" became the title tune for the French radio show "Salut les Copains" on Europe 1.
This music was used during telecasts of the "NBA on CBS" in the '70s (roughly around 1975-76) as the play-by-play announcer would give a preview to the game featured.
It featured in the 1988 Keanu Reeves film "The Night Before".
In the early 1990s a cover version by Adrian Edmondson's band The Bum Notes was used for the closing credits of the BBC sitcom "Bottom", which starred Edmondson and Rik Mayall.
It appeared in the 1998 film "Blues Brothers 2000", re-recorded by the Blues Brothers Band, and during the closing credits of 2007 film "Rush Hour 3".
The music was also used in the legal comedy-drama "Ally McBeal" (1999, episode "Sideshow", second season).
The Ventures released a version on their 1963 Dolton album "The Ventures Play Telstar and the Lonely Bull", BST 8019.
Laurel Aitken & The Soulmen released a 45 single version in 1966.
Ace Cannon opened his 1967 album "Memphis Golden Hits" with his version.
Screamin' Jay Hawkins released a risqué version entitled “Bite it” on his record "Because is in your mind" in 1970.

<doc id="9364056" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9364056" title="Behemoth (Hobbes book)">
Behemoth (Hobbes book)

Behemoth, full title Behemoth: the history of the causes of the civil wars of England, and of the counsels and artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1660, also known as The Long Parliament, is a book written by Thomas Hobbes discussing the English Civil War. Published posthumously in 1681, it was written in 1668, but remained unpublished at the request of Charles II of England.
"Behemoth" was written in 1668 as a follow-up to a previous and scandalous political work, "Leviathan" (1651). "Leviathan" is a representation of an ideal political world, and "Behemoth" has been considered to be a contrasting treatise on what happens when the very worst abuses of government come to pass. Hobbes applied his understanding of the science of human nature to explain why the English Civil War came to pass. He was able to do this because he "did not make an impassable gulf between his rational understanding on the one hand and the particular events which he witnessed, remembered, or heard about on the other". The book is written in the form of a discourse between two men. The first speaker, called only "A", is an eyewitness and possible insider to the events of the English Civil War. The second speaker, referred to as "B", is a student aiming to understand the breakdown in the government of England at that time.
Hobbes was refused permission by King Charles II to publish "Behemoth". While the king recognised the correctness of the account of events and issues, he was concerned that the book would not be well received. Charles withheld his permission to publish, in the hope that Hobbes would avoid further scandal, and perhaps see his reputation as a thinker restored.
The manuscript for "Behemoth" was pirated and printed in unauthorised editions in Europe during the 1670s and in a letter to his friend John Aubrey, Hobbes stated his disappointment with this turn of events. An official edition was released three years after Hobbes' death in 1679, by his literary agent William Crooke. According to Aloysius Martinich, "after its initial success the book was relatively unread and unstudied until there was a resurgence of interest in it in the last quarter of the twentieth century".
"Behemoth" is not entirely factual, accurate or literal in retelling of the events of the English Civil War but still has value that it has for students of the history of thought or revolution. As Royce MacGillivray puts it:
Hobbes instead is drawing on his memories of the events and on two other possible sources, both written by James Heath around 1663. These are "A Brief Chronicle of all the Chief Actions" and the expanded "A Brief Chronicle of the Late Intestine Warr". It is possible they were simply used as prompts for Hobbes, already 80 years old when he wrote "Behemoth". According to MacGillivray very little material from these sources found its way directly into the text.
"The summation below is just that, a summation, and is only the most basic part of each section. No effort is made to correct any inconsistencies introduced into the discussion between the master and the student so that the information may be presented as it was written by Thomas Hobbes."
The 1682 edition of the book begins with a note from William Crooke in answer to why he was publishing this edition. Hobbes had made Crooke the caretaker of his literary estate in July 1679. Crooke knew of the editions of "Behemoth" published in Europe and he reasoned that these editions did not show the work in the best possible light due to the many textual errors and omissions. It would therefore be best to publish an authorized edition to correct these errors and show the work as Hobbes wanted it to be read. Crooke had as his source a manuscript copy of the text given to him by Thomas Hobbes around 1670.
This is the longest section of the book and roughly covers the period 1640–1642.
The dialogue opens with the student asking the master how it was that a monarch as strong as Charles I should ever have had to face a rebellion. The master relates that a growing opposition to the crown was promoted by seven factions, each of them for their own ends and not in concert, who stoked the fires of rebellion. These factions were: Papists, Presbyterians, Independents including other sects of religious faith, those who were corrupted by their reading of the Latin and Greek classics, centres of commerce and trade such as London, those with no means of support who saw the war as a way to profit, and the lack of understanding as to the important role played by the monarchy in society.
The motivations of each of these groups and how they contributed to the Civil War is discussed by the master and the student throughout the first part of the book. This section has been considered anti-clerical in its leanings as none of the actions of the religious groups involved are shown in any sort of positive light.
The Papists wanted to condemn any ruler who did not offer compliance to the will of Rome. As Charles I was officially a Protestant, this was not popular. There were not many Papists in England at this time but they still had a voice that could be heard by their own adherents.
Presbyterian ministers did not like a king whose queen was a known and practising Catholic. This translated itself into speeches calling for the exile of the queen and other Papists. As Catholicism was already severely proscribed against in the late 17th century these calls for expulsion are not unexpected or difficult to understand.
The Independents and the other sects of the Protestant reformation were advocates of liberty and freedom in certain instances especially in the matter of religious choice. Provided an individual did not want to follow the Roman church their religious views would be tolerated by most of the Protestant groups.
The issue of an absolute monarchy was a crucial cause of the Civil War according to Hobbes. Many members of the House of Parliament who wanted a monarchy did not want it to be an absolute one. Instead they desired that it act in consultation with the house before taking action. Charles I did not see the powers of the crown as being answerable to any but God. Parliament then acted to withhold required funds from the King in his quest to defeat the rebellious Scots. The Scots, Hobbes tells us, were in arms over the practice of episcopacy. This weakened the power of the crown but Charles I drew on the nobility to supply the needed funds for the war. When this source ran out Charles turned to Parliament to raise the Ship Money, a percentage of customs revenue given to the King for the upkeep of the navy, so that he could use these funds to continue the war against the Scots. Parliament declared that illegal and took the crown to court over the issue.
The universities are brought into the discussion at this point. They existed as places where one could learn the classics and supposedly sharpen their minds by doing so. Instead they did not have the wit to read the classics critically and took them at their face value. This translated into certain scholars advocating an idealised form of republic to their students. However they did not teach the many virtues of the monarch to their students who came to see the crown as irresponsible.
Hobbes reminds his student that obedience is all that is required to live a good and peaceful life. This obedience should extend to the crown as it does to God and one's parents but this is not what was preached by the Protestant clergy. Instead they advised disobedience of royal edicts such as the raising privately of funds for the king's use. When this directive for disobedience was coupled with the teachings of ancient rebellions as a way to remove so called despotic domains it left a fertile ground for revolution in England.
The second section picks up the conversation on the following day and discusses how those who sought rebellion now began to make preparations for it to come to pass.
The people of England had become accustomed to hear from those whom they trusted, namely the bishops and the members of Parliament, how corrupted the crown had become. Now the discussion turned to a supposed plot by the King and Queen to return the realm to the church of Rome. The king responded by banishing some who had written pamphlets and sermons suggesting this return to Catholicism. Parliament had three of them released and they were received triumphantly in London upon their return.
In an effort to further weaken the King Parliament sought to have removed those members who were supporters of the monarchy. To this end the house impeached the Lord of Strafford for treason to Parliament and had him beheaded. Next Parliament arrested and executed the Archbishop of Canterbury for his preaching of the introduction of arbitrary government ruled in consultation of the bishops. This was opposed by many in Parliament but mainly by the Scots.
After this discussion Hobbes' master provides a history of the house of commons and its role in the governance of the realm. He reminds his student that the Parliament had always been an institution of counsel and not control over the monarchy. The present Parliament oversteps the ancient bounds imposed on it by its appointed role as representative of the people before the king.
The rising in Ireland of an army of Papist sympathies who busied themselves harassing and slaughtering Protestants becomes an issue before the Parliament. A truce is made with the king to arrange a militia to combat this uprising in Ireland. Charles I dismissed the charges of high treason but would not identify his informant in the commons. The solicitor general is accused of being an informer on the house and he flees to France to avoid the wrath of the Parliament.
Parliament next took control of the militia from the crown and insisted that no adherents of the Roman church be allowed to command the army being sent to Ireland. Parliament raised funds for this expedition by selling shares of land in the Irish province of Ulster. A small share, three pence on every acre, was reserved for the crown with the balance of the funds being set aside for Parliament. The king did not assent to this. Relations between the two sides once again broke down and the king issued a declaration that Parliament needed to be obedient to the established laws of the kingdom.
Both sides began to gather material and men for possible war. The Parliament sent a message to the king, a humble petition, with 19 propositions to prevent conflict. The nineteen points are:
These nineteen points were rejected by the king as they would further weaken the authority of the crown. This left both Parliament and the king no choice but to go to war.
"See the related article Nineteen Propositions for a further discussion of this aspect of the English Civil War.
The discussion again continues after a break and now turns to the matter of the Civil war itself. The student is concerned about what he sees as the inability of Charles I to stand up to the Parliament due to his overall lack of resources as Parliament has taken control of much of the necessary material to fight a war. The master reminds the student that the officers on the side of the crown were all well experienced men and that this was an advantage that the Parliamentarians did not have. As for money, neither side had much on hand. Some of the forces supporting the king took future credit while those supporting the Parliament were funded by an appeal to the cities and by the placing of levies on the towns.
As the wars continued men on both side of the struggle changed side. This at first was to the detriment of the Parliamentary forces but in time some of those loyal to the king began to support the cause of the Parliament. This was despite the king's ancient right to call for arms in times of conflict from all land owners and high born people. The Parliamentarians had already abandoned most of the laws and so this most ancient call to arms for the king was largely ignored.
The progress of the wars showed that early on the victory was mainly had by the king's cavaliers over Parliament's forces. Mainly in the north and the west of the country Charles I had his successes. Scotland came into the war on the side of Parliament and this put some pressure on the crowns forces. This pressure was used by Oliver Cromwell in 1644 to win the Battle of Marston Moor. This marks the rise of Oliver Cromwell in the Parliamentary army and he would use these successes to eventually take over the control of the commonwealth as Lord Protector.
In 1645 Cromwell reorganised Parliaments forces into the New Model Army. This was a more disciplined and better trained group of soldiers and with this the tide began to turn against the royalist cause. In 1646 the besieged Charles I received from Parliament the same nineteen points that had brought both sides to conflict. Charles again did not give assent to them. Instead an arrangement was brokered between Parliament and the king that would see him surrender himself to them and thus end the war. By the end of 1646 the great seal of the king was broken and power over England was now available to be taken.
1647 and 1648 saw the contention for control over the realm between Oliver Cromwell, with his New Model Army, and the Parliament as the king was held prisoner and not permitted to govern. Cromwell controlled 55 members of the parliament and used them to gain further support for his control over the government. Cromwell made overtures to the king to gain those members who had supported the royalist cause. London tried to stand against Cromwell but was quickly put down. He continued to consolidate his power and eventually had control over the parliament. He did not turn control back to the king as he said he would.
Charles I was as unwilling to work with Parliament under the control of Cromwell and the generals as he had been before the Civil War. Cromwell removed opposition in the house, leaving what became known as the Rump Parliament, and began a charge against the king for his part in bringing about the war.
The king was brought before Parliament, the charges read, and the king denied the authority of Parliament to charge him. This occurred three times and each time Parliament asserted that they did have the necessary authority. Charles was found guilty of tyranny and executed at the gates of Whitehall on 30 January 1649.
The Rump Parliament became an Oligarchy after the execution of Charles I. A forty-person council of state, whose job was to carry out the directives of the Rump Parliament, was established. The Parliament took the name "Custodes Libertatis Angliae" (Custodians of English Liberty) for use in legal matters. Hobbes saw this as being foolish as they did not have a good idea of what liberty actually meant.
Cromwell, not yet the sole head of the government, went with the army to Ireland and in a year subdued the entire country. In Scotland the Earl of Montrose failed to get the people behind a rising against the Parliament and was executed. Cromwell's rival, General Fairfax, resigned instead of taking an army into Scotland to fight fellow Presbyterians. Cromwell was now made general of the entire army.
Charles II went to Scotland, after agreeing to the demands of the Scots Parliament and sat as king. Hostilities between England and Scotland recommenced. Cromwell and the army invaded Scotland to capture the young king. Charles II, after failing to hold Edinburgh or Stirling, was able to escape to the Continent.
The Rump responded to an altercation with the Dutch and it began the First Anglo–Dutch War in 1652. Cromwell continued to fight the enemies of England while he solidified his hold over the Parliament. Cromwell was able to dissolve Parliament on 23 April 1653. A new parliament was composed of 142 of Cromwell's staunchest supporters from the army and the old Parliament. He gave them supreme power, and they in return appointed him Protector of England. The Dutch were defeated by the English, and Cromwell now had control of all of England.
In 1657 Cromwell was offered the title of king but refused it due to the opposition of the army, his source of power, to the idea. Parliament began to descend into disorder as factionalism again crept into its proceedings. Cromwell managed to keep the various factions in line.
After Cromwell's death the Parliament fell into disarray. General Monck saw that the only solution to the troubles was not to have Richard Cromwell succeed his father but to restore the monarchy. Monck occupied London with the army and forced parliament to offer the crown to Charles II. The monarchy was then restored when Charles II accepted the offer of the Parliament.
Immanuel Kant, one of the leading intellects of the Age of Enlightenment, had a different view on the nature of rebellions from Hobbes. Howard Williams, of the University of Wales, in 2003 wrote a study comparing the views of the two great thinkers on the subject of revolution amongst other things. Hobbes saw all revolution as something that should be avoided at all costs. Hobbes expressed society as a combination of the people, as the body of the society, and the monarchy, as the soul of the society, making a healthy commonwealth. Without the soul the body dies and so it is with society for Hobbes. Civil war should be avoided because it is "the process of a society losing its soul". In this book Williams describes Hobbes writing of "Behemoth" as an attempt to "capture the spirit of those awful times and to suggest emphatically that they should not be repeated". Hobbes did not believe that anything positive came out of the civil war.
Kant, according to Williams, shares the same basic attitude to the resistance of sovereign power but does not think that all outcomes of Rebellion are necessarily negative. Kant is writing about the French Revolution, not the English Civil War, in his book "The Conflict of the Faculties". Written more than 100 years after Hobbes wrote "Behemoth", it has as its focus the idea that rebellions arouse sympathy in other countries for the people caught up in them. Kant says that this is due to a "moral disposition within the human race". Going further Kant, according to Williams, implies that uprisings are the wrong solution to a problem with governance but that there can still be something positive in the results of that uprising.
Hobbes does not think that there is any sort of innate morality in society and that rebellion is either "an unwise or failed experiment as a complete blunder arising from ignorance". Instead, according to Williams, Hobbes has sympathy not for the common people caught up in the rebellion but instead for those who were the victims of the rebellion. This is in keeping with the royalist stance taken by Hobbes in "Behemoth".
The French Revolution was not the only source for Kant's views on rebellion. He took into account the American Revolutionary War and the English Civil war as well as the views of classical thinking on the nature of republics. Hobbes, of course, could not do this. Kant as well was more of an observer than a participant in the events of these revolutions. Hobbes was deeply affected by the Civil war and believed that rebellion would not be a solution. Instead "only an absolute sovereign power could teach 'the science of just and unjust', fixing meanings in a stable way and thus inducing social cohesion".
Hobbes then is a supporter of an "absolute sovereignty, embodied in a monarch or corporate body of individuals; Kant is a supporter of popular sovereignty, embodied in the law-making powers of a group of the people's representatives". Another key difference between the two philosophers is the way that the laws of the land should be administered. An absolute monarch, for Hobbes, implies that the authority of that monarch "must be beyond question, whereas for Kant the sovereign's authority is best safeguarded through the possibility of public debate and criticism". These fundamental differences in thinking are perhaps more to do with the differences in the eras the two philosophers lived in. Hobbes lived a hundred years before Kant. Additionally Hobbes experienced rebellion first hand, even to the point of fleeing England for fear of his personal safety, whereas Kant did not directly suffer during the rebellions that occurred in his lifetime. Another consideration was that in the course of a century much more had been written on the subject of the rights of the people and of liberty and this too must have been an influence on Kant's point of view. This does not negate Hobbes' views on rebellion but does illuminate a probable cause for his position on them.

Zeyrek Mosque

Zeyrek Mosque (full name in ) or Pantokrator Monastery (in ), is a significant mosque in Istanbul, made of two former Eastern Orthodox churches and a chapel. It represents the most typical example of architecture of the Byzantine middle period in Constantinople and is, after Hagia Sophia, the second largest religious edifice built by the Byzantines remaining in Istanbul.
The complex is placed in "Fazilet Sokağı", in the district of Fatih, in a popular neighborhood which got its name ("Zeyrek") from the Mosque, and less than one km to the southeast of Eski Imaret Mosque. It is picturesque but (as of 2007) decayed and dangerous in the night hours.
Between 1118 and 1124 Byzantine Empress Eirene Komnena built a monastery on this site dedicated to Christ Pantokrator. The monastery consisted of a main church (which became the Katholikon of the monastery ) also dedicated to the Pantokrator, a library and a hospital.
After the death of his wife, shortly after 1124, Emperor John II Komnenos built another church to the north of the first dedicated to the Theotokos Eleousa ("the merciful"). This church was open to the population and served by a lay clergy. Finally (the terminus ante quem is 1136 ) a south courtyard and an exonarthex were added to the complex, and the two shrines were connected with a chapel (dedicated to Saint Michael ), which became the imperial mausoleum ("heroon") of the Komnenos and Palaiologos dynasties. Besides many Byzantine dignitaries, Emperor John II and his wife Eirene, Empress Bertha of Sulzbach (also known as Eirene, and wife of Manuel I Komnenos), and Emperor John V Palaiologos were buried here.
During the Latin domination after the Fourth Crusade, the complex was the see of the Venetian clergy, and the icon of the Theotokos Hodegetria was housed here. The monastery was also used as an imperial palace by the last Latin Emperor, Baldwin. After the Palaiologan restoration the monastery was used again by Orthodox monks. The most famous among them was Gennadius II Scholarius, who left the Pantokrator to become the first Patriarch of Constantinople after the Islamic conquest of the city.
Shortly after the Fall of Constantinople the building was converted into a mosque, and the monastery was converted for a while into a Medrese. The Ottomans named it after "Molla Zeyrek", a scholar who was teaching there. However, due to its importance in Byzantine history, Zeyrek was one among the few buildings of Istanbul whose ancient denomination was never forgotten. Among others, the church of Pantokrator is remembered by Pierre Gilles in his classic work about Constantinople, written in the sixteenth century. After the completion of the Medreses in the Fatih complex in 1471, the students abandoned Zeyrek, and the rooms of the monastery occupied by the Medrese vanished later.
Until a few years ago, the edifice was in a desolate state, and as a result it was added to the UNESCO watchlist of endangered monuments. During the recent years it underwent extensive (albeit still unfinished) restoration.
Today Zeyrek Mosque is - after Hagia Sophia - the second largest extant religious edifice built by the Byzantines in Istanbul.
To the East lies the Ottoman Konak ("Zeyrek Hane"), which has also been restored and is now open as a restaurant and tea garden.
The masonry has been partly built adopting the technique of the "recessed brick", typical of the Byzantine architecture of the middle period. In this technique, alternate courses of bricks are mounted behind the line of the wall, and are plunged in a mortar's bed. Due to that, the thickness of the mortar layers is about three times greater than that of the bricks layers.
The south and the north church are both cross domed with polygonal apses having seven sides, and not five as was typical in the Byzantine architecture of the previous century. The apses have also triple lancet windows flanked by niches.
The southern church is the largest. To the East it has an esonarthex, which later was extended up to the imperial chapel. The church is surmounted by two domes, one over the "naos" and the other over the "matroneum" (a separate upper gallery for women) of the narthex.
The decoration of this church, which was very rich, disappeared almost completely, except for some fragments of marble in the presbyterium and, above all, a beautiful floor in opus sectile made with colored marbles worked in cloisonné technique, where human and animal figures are represented. Moreover, fragments of colored glass suggest that the windows of this church were once made of stained glass bearing figures of Saints. The mosaics of the interior, representing the apostles and the life of Christ, were still visible - although defaced - in the 18th century.
The imperial chapel is covered by barrel vaults and is surmounted by two domes too.
The north church has only one dome, and is notable for its frieze, carved with a dog's tooth and triangle motif running along the eaves line.
Close to the Mosque is placed the small Şeyh Süleyman Mescidi, a small byzantine building belonging also to the Pantokrator Monastery.
As a whole, this complex represents the most typical example of architecture of the Byzantine middle period in Constantinople.

Hold on to Your Friends

"Hold On to Your Friends" is a song by Morrissey, released as a single in May 1994. It was the second single taken from the number 1 album "Vauxhall and I".
Reaching number 47 in the UK Singles Chart, the single became Morrissey's lowest charting single until "Glamorous Glue" in 2011, which reached number 69.
Ned Raggett of AllMusic thought the song featured a strong performance from the group but was "not one of the album's immediately strongest points", although it "isn't a bad listen at all." He was more impressed by the cover version of Moon River on the B-side which had a "surprisingly affecting" performance from Morrissey and a good production.
The song was performed live by Morrissey on his 1995 and 1997 tours.

Mototeru Takagi

Mototeru Takagi (高木元輝) (28 December 1941 – December 2002) was a Japanese tenor saxophone player, known for playing in a distinctive and powerful free jazz style. He played with many of the most important Japanese free groups and musicians during the seventies, such as ESSG and those of Masahiko Togashi, Motoharu Yoshizawa and Masayuki Takayanagi.
Takagi was born in Osaka in 1941, but grew up in Yokohama. During his younger years, he spent time in the bands of players like Charlie Ishiguro and Hisashi Sakurai, but only really began developing his distinctive free style when he joined the Motoharu Yoshizawa Trio in 1968. The following year he joined Togashi's Quartet and ESSG. After Togashi's accident, Takagi played briefly with Masayuki Takayangi's New Direction Unit and in a duo with percussionist Sabu Toyozumi. From November 1973 he spent one year playing in France, returning to Japan in November 1974. Takagi recorded very few albums as a leader over the course of his career, but he was highly valued as a collaborator by many Japanese jazz, rock and avant-garde musicians.

Arghiri Emmanuel

Arghiri Emmanuel (; June 22, 1911, Patras, Greece – December 14, 2001, Paris, France) was a Greek-French Marxian economist who became known in the 1960s and 1970s for his theory of 'unequal exchange'.
The theory was an attempt to explain the falling trend in the terms of trade for underdeveloped countries, while criticising the different approaches of Raúl Prebisch, Hans Singer, and Arthur Lewis to do so as only half-hearted attempts. It stated, contrary to the then conventional Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson theory, that it was politically and historically set wage-levels that determined relative prices, not the other way around, and, contrary to the assumptions of Ricardo's comparative costs, that capital was internationally mobile and the rate of profit correspondingly equalised.
What made the theory a heated subject in Marxist and "dependentista" circles was the theory's implications about international worker solidarity. Emmanuel was not late to point out that his theory fitted well with the observed absence of such solidarity, particularly between high- and low-wage countries, and, in fact, made the nationally enclosed workers movements into the principal cause of unequal exchange.
By contrast, all subsequent versions of the theory such as those by Samir Amin, Oscar Braun, Jan Otto Andersson, Paul Antoine Delarue, and almost every critic since Charles Bettelheim, have preferred to make higher productivity the cause (and thereby justification) of higher wages, and 'monopolies' the cause of unequal exchange.
Emmanuel's theory of unequal exchange was part of a more comprehensive explanation of the post-war capitalist economy. In Emmanuel's view, because selling had to take place without the income generated by the sale itself, there was a permanent excess of (the value of) goods over (the purchasing power of) income in the normal workings of a market economy. This obliged the economy to function below its full potential and made it prone to crises such as the one he had himself experienced during the Great Depression. By contrast, the boom of the 'thirty glorious' post-war years indicated that this normal functioning had somehow been evaded, and Emmanuel now offered the institutionalised rise in wages, plus a policy of permanent inflation, as the principal stimulant directing the boom in investments. Since neither the wage- nor the consumption levels of the well-off countries could be internationally equalised - upwards for both ecological reasons and because it would eat up all profits, and downwards for political reasons in the same rich countries - unequal exchange was the necessary consequence, in a sense saving the capitalist economy from itself.
Not much is known about Emmanuel's whereabouts in the years before moving to France. He was born in Patras, Greece, the son of Charalambos Emmanuel and Katina (born Menounou). Studied at the High School of Economics and Commerce from 1927 to 1932 and then at the Faculty of Law until 1934, from where he went on to work in commerce in Athens until 1937.
While his later works clearly identify him as a Marxist or communist of sorts, it is still uncertain when and under which circumstances he began considering himself as such. Publishing articles at least from 1928, an interest in Marxist theory is evidenced in a 1937 article on 'psychoanalysis as a global theory and dialectical materialism', and yet another on gold as an 'unwelcome immigrant' perhaps links to a long-standing concern with gold and the special economic role of the money commodity. No published record of membership in a communist party is familiar, and it was uncommon in Greece until the Resistance years of World War II, but his later works identified him as a 'paleo-Marxist', both in the historical materialist sense and as a supporter of centralised economic planning, even on a global scale.
Changes in the American immigration policies closed the traditional Greek safety vault, and under the yoke of depression and General Metaxas's dictatorship (1936–1941), Emmanuel, in 1937, went to work in commerce in the Belgian Congo. In 1942, Emmanuel volunteered for the Greek Liberation Forces in the Middle East, and was active in the April 1944 left-wing uprising of the Middle Eastern forces against the government-in-exile in Cairo. In fact, the uprising was not supported by EAM (National Liberation Front) (nor by Stalin), to whom it came rather inconveniently, and it was soon put down by British troops and Emmanuel sentences to death by a Greek court-martial in Alexandria. The mutiny appears to have been directed more immediately against the return of the monarch, so that participation does not in itself suggest communist or Marxist leanings, rather than merely republican, although in Emmanuel's case this would seem probable.
By the end of 1945 he was pardoned and returned to the Belgian Congo, where there now had grown a small community of Greeks and Portuguese, in addition to the African and Belgian ones. Here, too, he participated in debates: on colonists and against the common accusation for illegitimate profits on behalf of colonial merchants (to whom Emmanuel and commonly other Greeks belonged). He may even have been in contact with the liberation movement to be organised around Lumumba in Stanleyville, but when the situation hardened in 1957, he prudently departed for France. Observations from the Congos appear frequently in his writings and can probably help explain the peculiarity of his approach and its differences to common French Marxism. After some years as an art student, and in the context of the publication of Frantz Fanon's "The Wretched of the Earth," Emmanuel began as a graduate student under Charles Bettelheim, the theme being his theory of unequal exchange which was first presented in 1961-1962.
While Bettelheim was certainly inspired by Paul A. Baran, the same is not evident for Emmanuel. In addition, many other differences were visible from the start, such as Bettelheim's desire to make unequal exchange due to wage differentials a subcategory of unequal exchange due to differences in 'organic composition' (i.e. capital intensity), which was common enough to Marxist understanding and continues to be the focus of modern 'developments' of the theory of unequal exchange. This distinction was also the cause of some confusion when the theory was eventually debated in the Anglo-Saxon world in the 1970s (among non-Marxists, e.g., Paul Samuelson, David Evans).

Levan Lagidze

Levan Lagidze (; (born 1958, Tbilisi) is a prominent Georgian painter.
Since early childhood, Levan Lagidze showed a keen interest and a sharp drive in various creative activities such as drawing, sculpting, and writing. Eventually, he decided to pursue painting and enrolled in the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts.
Lagidze's diploma work "Tbilisoba" was acclaimed as the best diploma work submitted from all of the USSR's arts schools in 1981. He graduated from the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts the same year.
After graduation, Levan Lagidze actively participated in various exhibitions throughout the USSR. In the early 1980s, Lagidze founded and led an arts studio at the Tbilisi Painter's House, which ran seminars and workshops, and offered a free work space for artists. In 1987, the studio presented its first major exhibition which received a warm welcome from viewers and critical acclaim from professionals and experts. Lagidze's students soon started to fill the ranks of the country's artistic elite.
Throughout his career, Levan Lagidze's primary themes and styles progressed from his early "narrative" paintings, to abstract philosophical depiction of an "eternal return". In the early 1980s, the artist's works focused around one major biblical theme - "the prodigal son". From the late 1980s, his interest shifted to fundamentally novel themes such as "secret", "return", and "early urbanism".
From the early 1990s, when the Soviet Union collapsed and the state ceased to allocate funding to artists, Levan Lagidze sold his only apartment and opened a gallery - "The Lagidze Gallery" - to provide financially troubled Georgian artists with an exhibition space.
From the late 1990s onward, Lagidze's artistic style gradually drifted to abstract painting. In later years, he mainly worked on depicting nature and landscapes in abstract perspective, although he avoids any reference to abstraction and claims that he only paints his own visual perceptions. Lagidze's latest abstract works include "The Meadow", "Autumn Meadows", and "The Plow".
Levan Lagidze's major works are exhibited in his own gallery which also serves as the artist's studio. This choice is explained by his preference for adjoining style and perspective while presenting his paintings to viewers. Lagidze's paintings are also in the collections of the Tretyakov Gallery and the Modern Art Museum in Moscow, Russia; the National Picture Gallery in Tbilisi, Georgia; the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, NJ, US; the Gertsev Gallery; and the TMS Gallery in Tbilisi, Georgia.
His works are also in private collections in Belgium, Canada, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, South Africa, UK, and the US.

Interlude (Morrissey and Siouxsie song)

"Interlude" is a single by Morrissey and Siouxsie Sioux released in August 1994. It was presented under the banner of "Morrissey & Siouxsie".
This collaboration was included in "Spin" magazine's list of the top 10 "one-off team-ups" of all time. The cover is a cropped version of the photograph "Girl Jiving in Southam St." by Roger Mayne, the model being Eileen Sheekey.
"Interlude" was recorded during the recording sessions for Morrissey's "Vauxhall and I" album, and was produced by Morrissey guitarist and musical director Boz Boorer. The original version of the song was recorded in 1968 by the female singer Timi Yuro as the title track for the film of the same name.
Morrissey first contacted Siouxsie in the early 1990s with a view to recording a duet with her. In 1993, he sent her a tape with some potential songs he had selected. All were numbers initially sung by female singers like Nancy Sinatra and Dionne Warwick. Siouxsie picked this ballad and Morrissey agreed. The sessions went well and Boorer later described his collaboration with Siouxsie as "complete joy".
Soon after the recording, however, the two singers fell out with one another regarding the content of the video. Ultimately, the video shoot never took place and the whole project was put on ice for a few months. EMI then threatened to not promote it without the existence of a supporting video. Although it was a "winter" song, against all expectations, EMI finally released "Interlude" in the summer of 1994.
Despite this, the single's chart peak (number 25 in the UK) was consistent with Siouxsie's other UK chart placing of the post-1992 era, when she never charted higher than number 21 in the UK with Siouxsie and the Banshees, after the release of the single "Face to Face". "Interlude" also charted considerably higher than Morrissey's previous single, "Hold on to Your Friends", which had flopped at number 47. "Interlude" was also issued in Europe via EMI. In North America, due to the impossibility of an agreement between Sire (Morrissey's US record company) and Geffen (Siouxsie's), the record was only available on import in very limited quantities.
"Interlude" was later included on a compilation called "". A previously unreleased version of the song, featuring only Morrissey's vocals, appeared on his 2011 "Very Best Of" compilation.
The single was positively received by MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic, who considered the performers to be "one of the finest duos in modern rock." The track's production was also praised: "The flowing string arrangements on "Interlude" are breathtaking, and appropriate to the talents of both artists."

Al Irata is a group that the United States Department of Defense identifies as a terrorist group.
One of the allegations prepared for Guantanamo captive Mohamed Atiq Awayd Al Harbi's "Combatant Status Review Tribunal" was:
A team of legal scholars at Seton Hall University, led by Mark Denbeaux and Joshua Denbeaux, published a number of criticism of the United States Department of Defense's intelligence efforts.
The second critical analysis they published was entitled: "Inter- and Intra-Departmental Disagreements About Who Is Our Enemy".
The authors pointed out that the continued detention of dozens of Guantanamo captives was justified, at least in part, by an alleged association with dozens of organizations that weren't listed on any of the United States' official lists of terrorist organizations, like the "no-fly list". The authors asked whether that meant visitors to the United States were being allowed entry, in spite of an association with organizations that posed real threats. Alternatively, they asked, did this mean Guantanamo captives were being detained for association with organizations that did not represent real threats.

Bregaglia Range

The Bregaglia Range (commonly the Bregaglia) is a small group of mostly granite mountains in Graubünden, Switzerland and the Province of Sondrio, northern Italy. It derives its name from the partly Swiss, partly Italian valley, the "Val Bregaglia", and is known as "Bergell" in German. Other names which are applied to the range include the Val Masino Alps and, to describe the main ridge, Masino-Bregaglia-Disgrazia. Vicosoprano (1,067 m) is the main settlement in the Swiss part of the range.
The range is a popular mountaineering destination, and includes such peaks as Monte Disgrazia, Piz Cengalo and Piz Badile. Well-known mountaineers who are associated with the area and have made significant first ascents in the range include Leslie Stephen, D. W. Freshfield, W. A. B. Coolidge, Christian Klucker, Paul Güssfeldt and Riccardo Cassin.
A cable-car service runs from Pranzaira to the Albigna lake, and the Albigna hut (2,331 m) is a further 30–45-minute walk up the east side of the barrage.

Prairie barn

The design of a prairie barn, also known as the Western barn, reflects the iconic image of an American barn. The peak roof over the hay loft is what helps give the prairie barn its familiarity across the landscape. It was popularized during the settlement of the American West during the 19th century.
Large herds of cattle, associated mostly with the American West, required vast amounts of space for hay and feed. Prairie barns are generally larger than other types of barns. The long, sweeping style roofs, sometimes reaching very near the ground, are trademark of prairie barns. The large roof areas provided for more storage space. Later in the 19th century barn architects adopted gambrel roofs, which provided even more storage space. Prairie barns share a number of features with the historic Dutch barn design. Long, low roof lines, gable end doors and the internal dispersal of stable stalls in aisles astride a central hallway are all elements of Dutch barns.

<doc id="9364311" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9364311" title="Titus Labienus (historian)">
Titus Labienus (historian)

Titus Labienus was an orator and historian in the time of Augustus, nicknamed Rabienus for his vigorous style. He killed himself when the Senate had his books burned. Caligula later overrode the Senate and had the books restored.
Little is known about his early life. He did not come from aristocracy or the influential Roman family Labieni. Instead, he grew up poor and unpopular.
Although in his youth Titus Labienus Rabienus was considered unimportant, as an adult he garnered fame for his works as an historian and orator and has come to be regarded as one of the most instrumental and important historians of all time. At the time, Rome was a new monarchy, Augustus had assumed power, and there was a lot of animosity in the air between the people who were for and those who were against the monarchy that had taken over the Roman Empire. Continuously, people would go throughout the city of Rome and either publicly state or publish pamphlets with negative comments and accusations about the new emperor and monarchy. Titus Labienus Rabienus eagerly joined the cause against the new monarchy, "flailing Augustan order" and vigorously supported Pompey the Great (106 BC to 46 BC), a statesman and general of the late Roman Republic and opponent of Julius Caesar for forming the monarchy.
As a historian, Titus Labienus would viciously attack the different classes of Roman society thus eventually leading to his nickname Rabienus or “rabid one”, for his "furious invective". His writings were full of such controversial material that when he recited his works in public, he would have to pass over sections that were too discordant. Instead, he would allude to the missing information by saying that they were to be read after his death. Titus Labienus Rabienus was also recognized throughout Rome as an important member of the academic profession or “manus orator”.
As time progressed the amount of pamphlets swirling about Rome began to grow and the Emperor Augustus began to put into place stricter regulations on writing, initially punishing any writers who attacked anyone (particularly himself) then moving to censor writings themselves.
As both an author and a professor, both changes to Roman law further angered Titus Labienus Rabienus. As an author he wanted the freedom to write what he wanted to write, not what the government wanted or would allow. And as a professor, he wanted to be able to teach the truth, not just what the Roman government wanted people to know. The loss in general of freedom of speech aggravated Titus Labienus Rabienus to voice his disapproval even more of the new monarchy. As even more time progressed, Augustus became even stricter until he finally created a new type of punishment for this “new crime” of voicing one’s opinion. With this new type of punishment, depending on how guilty one was or how serious the crime one committed against the state was, either one or all one’s life works were to be burned at the stake. When the new law was first declared, even members of the Senate thought that was “an unusual way of inflicting punishment upon scholarship.”
It was the professors, like Titus Labienus Rabienus, who began to feel the effects of the new law first because it was also illegal to even own, carry, or read any of the restricted material that was to be burned at the stake. His conflict with the government eventually led to his own trial (6 to 8 AD), the first of its kind, where the senate found him guilty of harming the state and literary treason and as the law stated, his life works were sentenced to the stake.
Upon hearing the verdict that he was guilty of literary treason and that his entire library was sentenced to flames, Titus Labienus Rabienus decided to kill himself. He went to the mausoleum of his ancestors, walled himself up and committed suicide, becoming the first Roman martyr. He refused his friends offers to cremate his body for he was not going to let the fiery element that had devoured his works touch him. Through his death, he was able to send a message about censorship to both Augustus, the emperor of Rome, and to Roman citizens.
By becoming the first Roman martyr and dying in such a dramatic fashion, Titus was able to bring attention to his cause and therefore rally more support. He had the academic world upset because he made them realize the tragic implications of having everything censored by the government. He made them think about all of the other classic writers who if they had been alive during this would have also had their works burned. He caused classrooms to discuss and debate the implications of his trial. He even got his enemy, Cassius Severus, to commit suicide declaring that if they wanted to destroy the works of Titus Labienus Rabienus, they would have to burn him alive as well because he knew them by heart. By having two of the best writers of time commit suicide, even more people began to take notice.
Two emperors later, Caligula assumed power and in 37 AD, reversing some of the damage Augustus caused when he was in power. He permitted the works of Titus Labienus Rabienus, along with a couple other authors’ works including Cassius Severus, to be hunted down and read again claiming that it was in his own best interest to have all events recorded for future reference.
Although at the time of his death, he thought the damage of the flames was irreversible and that all of his life works were gone, many of his friends and fellow scholars risked their lives to save his works. Because of the risks they all took, fifty years later his works were listed as standard classroom material by Quintilian.

Ford Taurus X

The Ford Freestyle also known as Ford Taurus X is a crossover utility vehicle that was sold by Ford from 2005 to 2009. Essentially the replacement for the Ford Taurus station wagon, the 2005-2007 Freestyle was produced in a single bodystyle with six or seven-passenger seating. As the Taurus made its return for 2008, the Freestyle was rebadged the Taurus X.
Manufactured alongside the Ford Five Hundred, Mercury Montego, Mercury Sable, and the 2008-2009 Ford Taurus, the Ford Freestyle/Taurus X shared the Volvo-derived Ford D3 platform. Front-wheel drive was standard, with all-wheel drive as an option. All versions were produced at Chicago Assembly, in Chicago, Illinois. Unlike the D3 sedans, the Freestyle/Taurus X was sold exclusively as a Ford. Following its discontinuation in 2009, it was not directly replaced, but its role in the Ford line was largely taken over by the larger Ford Flex.
The Taurus X ended production on February 27, 2009 and was marketed in the United States and Canada, as well as South Korea and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam.
The Freestyle was previewed at the 2003 Detroit Auto Show with a Freestyle Concept before entering production for the 2005 model year. The vehicle was originally going to be called the Ford CrossTrainer, but had been renamed the Freestyle by the time the concept was released, due to Ford adopting an ill-fated naming scheme in which all Ford-branded passenger cars except the Mustang and Thunderbird would have a name start with the letter "F".
For the Freestyle/Taurus X, Ford used its Volvo-derived D3 platform architecture. Sharing a common platform with the Ford Five Hundred and Mercury Montego, all four vehicles were derived from the Volvo P2 platform used for the first-generation Volvo S80 and Volvo XC90. To accommodate production costs for Ford and durability concerns for North American roads, a number of revisions were made to the platform, making the final vehicles significantly different.
Power came from a 3.0 L (181 cu in) Duratec V6, with an output of at 5750 rpm. The Freestyle, along with the Five Hundred, Mercury Montego, and the Ford Escape Hybrid, were the first American Ford vehicles to use a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Five Hundred and Montego used a belt type CVT, while the Escape Hybrid used a CVT transaxle that utilized a planetary gearset controlled by the electric generator, similar to the Toyota Prius. All Freestyles were equipped with the CVT, but only all-wheel drive (AWD) Five Hundred and Montego models used the CVT (FWD versions used an Aisin F21++ six speed automatic). 55% of buyers selected the Haldex Traction-equipped all-wheel drive model rather than the expected 40%.
Introduced as a 2005 model largely in place of the Ford Taurus station wagon, the Freestyle was marketed as a crossover utility vehicle, a new market segment at the time. As with the Ford Five Hundred/Mercury Montego, the Freestyle was available with front-wheel drive as standard with all-wheel drive as an option; the CVT of the all-wheel drive Five Hundred was the sole transmission on the Freestyle. The 203hp 3.0L Duratec V6 was the standard engine.
In contrast to a Taurus station wagon, the Freestyle featured forward-facing third-row seating (similar to the Ford Explorer and Ford Expedition). Although designed with ground clearance between a sedan and a small SUV, the Freestyle featured what Ford described as "command seating," seating with a higher H-point, to increase driver visibility and ease of entry and exit.
The Freestyle was nominated for the "North American Truck of the Year" award for 2005 (placing second behind the Ford Escape Hybrid).
In 2007, shortly after becoming CEO of Ford Motor Company, Alan Mulally called for a revision of the Ford and Mercury model ranges, saying that the shift towards Ford nameplates starting with the letter "F" was forgettable in the eyes of consumers. A key part of the decision was the reinstatement of the Ford Taurus nameplate, which would take the place of the Ford Five Hundred as a mid-cycle update for the 2008 model year. As the Ford Taurus would be produced exclusively as a sedan, the all-new Ford Taurus X nameplate was introduced to take the place of the Freestyle. The nameplate change was announced shortly after its unveiling at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show as a 2008 production model.
To bring it in line with the styling of other Ford light-truck lines, the Taurus X was given a flush-mounted three-bar horizontal chrome grille (similar to the Ford Edge, as are the headlights). As with the Freestyle, on non-Limited trims, the lower body and wheel well trim were painted in a contrasting color (as with all Ford SUVs). Matching the Ford Explorer, the Taurus X introduced an outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer trim level.
As with its sedan counterpart, the Taurus X featured major powertrain updates over its predecessor. The 203hp 3.0L V6 was replaced by an all-new 3.5L Duratec 35 V6 engine, raising output to 263hp. The ZF-Batavia CVT was replaced by an all-new Ford/GM 6-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel drive remained an option. To increase its functionality, the Taurus X featured new power options, including a power-operated rear liftgate and power-folding second-row seats.
Although the renaming of the Taurus sedan would improve its sales over the Five Hundred, the renaming of the Freestyle to the Taurus X would have the opposite effect, leading to a major decrease in sales. During its production, the Taurus X was partially affected by the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10. Although more fuel-efficient than SUVs than the V8-engined Ford Expedition and Ford Explorer, full-size crossovers such as the Taurus X were avoided in favor of smaller crossovers and sedans.
In 2009, the Ford Flex was introduced as the replacement for the discontinued Ford Freestar/Mercury Monterey. The Taurus X was discontinued for the 2010 model year, with the Flex unofficially serving as its replacement.
SE: Offered only from 2004–06, it included basic features such as an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and four speakers, keyless entry, and steel wheels with hubcaps.
SEL: Offered from 2004–09, the SEL model had the features of the SE plus the option of leather seating, rear DVD, and an AM/FM stereo with a six-disc CD/MP3 changer and seven premium Audiophile speakers. It also offered optional 2nd-row captain's chairs and a standard 3rd-row bench. It also had 17" tires with alloy wheels. The option of two-tone exterior paint was offered. After it was restyled as the Taurus X, Ford Sync and Bluetooth became options.
Eddie Bauer Edition: Following the other SUV's in Ford's lineup, the EB Edition included two-tone unique leather seating, standard Ford Sync, and standard Pueblo Gold Metallic two-tone exterior paint. It was only offered for 2008.
Limited: Offered from 2004–09, the Limited model had all the features of the SEL plus standard leather seating, seven speakers, and standard 2nd-row captain's chairs. It also offered monotone paint. It had 18" tires and wheels.

British Orthodontic Society

The British Orthodontic Society (BOS) is a membership organisation with over 1800 members in the United Kingdom. It is the largest of the dental specialist groups and dates back nearly a century to the formation of the British Society for the Study of Orthodontics. Other orthodontic groups were founded in the over the years and in 1994 they all came together to create the British Orthodontic Society.
The BOS describes itself as being dedicated to promoting the study and practice of orthodontics, maintaining and improving professional standards and encouraging education and research in the specialism.
Members of the society are entitled to discounts for BOS events, such as the annual British Orthodontic Conference, which is one of the best-attended events in the dental calendar. Members also receive the BOS news and the "Journal of Orthodontics" as part of their membership subscription.
In 2011 a small breakaway group set up a reformed BSSO group as they felt the BOS was not fulfilling its charitable aims as they wished. This however has only led to one or two resignations from the society and the vast majority of members support the aims of the society and feel that the unification of the old societies has benefitted patients as has pooling resources and speaking with one voice. The unified Society is far greater than the sum of the individual societies. The Trustees of the Society have no intention of changing the stated charitable aims of the British Orthodontic Society which are promoting the study and practice of orthodontics, maintaining and improving professional standards and encouraging education and research in the specialty."
The current BOS headquarters opened in 2006 and occupies two floors of a Victorian building at 12 Bridewell Place within the City of London’s ancient walls and St Paul’s Cathedral is nearby.

Hinduism in Mexico

There are about 800 Indian families in Mexico, constituting a total number of about 900 NRIs. Most of them are recent arrivals in the country. There is a big presence of recently arrived Indians working for Tata Consultancy Services in Guadalajara, Querétaro and Mexico City. Mexico has a non-discriminatory policy with regard to the grant of its citizenship. The spouse of a Mexican national would generally not face any problem in acquiring local citizenship. But although quite a few NRIs have married Mexicans, they have retained their Indian citizenship.
The Indians in this country are mainly businessmen or professionals. Many of them work with one or other international organisation or a multinational corporation.
There are also some academicians and scientists among them. They have helped to bring about greater mutual understanding between India and their host country. At present, Dr Sanjay Rajaram (a distinguished Indian scientist and Padma Shri award recipient) is also in Mexico, working at CIMMYT. Some of the Indians work for ISPAT Mexicana. This company is part of the Laxmi Mittal group, well known in this region for having turned around a sinking steel company in Trinidad. The Indian presence in Mexico has been greatly appreciated as fifty other business ventures have invested around US$1.58 billion in this country during the period 1994-2000.
Most members of the diaspora speak Spanish and have adapted themselves admirably to their foreign environment.
The Indian community in Mexico has no divisive factions in it, although its constituents come from different parts of India. It has jointly established an organisation called Sangam, under whose auspices it celebrates important festivals and cultural programmes.
A Sai Baba temple and a Vaishnav temple have been constructed in Mexico City by the Sangam Organisation.

Natalia Toledo

Natalia Toledo Paz (born 1968) is a Mexican poet who writes in Spanish and Zapotec. Her work has helped to revive interest in the Zapotec language. Ida Kozlowska-Day states that Toledo is "one of the most recognized contemporary poets in the native languages of Mexico."
Toledo Paz was born in Juchitán de Zaragoza, Oaxaca. She is daughter of the painter Francisco Toledo and sister of Dr Lakra. Until she was seven and moved to Mexico City, Toledo Paz lived in a community where Zapotec was the main language spoken. Toledo Paz has been writing since she was young. Toledo Paz studied in Casa de la Cultura de Juchitán and Sociedad General de Escritores de México (the General Society of Writers of Mexico, SOGEM).
Toledo Paz has been a fellow of Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes (the National Fund for Culture and for the Arts, FONCA) (1994–1995; 2001–2002), and Fondo Estatal para la Cultura y las Artes de Oaxaca (the Fund for Culture and for the Arts of Oaxaca, FOESCA) (1995–1996).
She is the president of Patronato de la Casa de la Cultura de Juchitán (Fund of the House of Culture of Juchitán).
Toledo Paz's writing has been concerned with women and their relationship to the environment. Toledo Paz along with other writer's use of the Zapotec language in their writing has helped boost a demand in Mexico to make indigenous cultures more visible. Toledo Paz enjoys using the Zapotec language because she feels that it has "a great aesthetic sensibility for creating images and beauty."
Toledo Paz has also collaborated with her father, Francisco, to create children's stories, such as "Light Foot/Pies ligeros" (2007).

Boxers (song)

"Boxers" is a song by Morrissey, released in January 1995 to promote a tour of the same name.
The single reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart, despite not featuring on an album at the time of the release. The title track and the two B-sides would later be complied on the "World of Morrissey" that was released in February that year.
The single was given a favourable review in "Q" magazine, with Ian Harrison writing that the song "is as good as anything he's done" and that the single made you "realise how few singers can leave you as despondent, elated or intrigued". "NME" on the other hand gave it a negative review, with John Mulvey declaring the single was "just another example of his tedious obsession with bits of rough who'd give him a kicking given half a chance" and that "any enjoyment of his records nowadays is tainted by the fact that a nasty taste from all those obnoxious, apologist, quasi-libertarian quotes still lingers."
In his review for AllMusic Ned Raggett found the song to be "a fine enough number, with a good overall performance and production to recommend it."
The song was performed live by Morrissey on his 1995 and 2000 tours.

Miles Cooper letter bomb campaign

In the United Kingdom, a series of seven letter bombs were sent during January and February 2007 to various companies and agencies, all related in some way to DNA testing and road transport. Police said that some of the letters were hand written and some typed. All seven letter bombs were sent in A5 Jiffy-style envelopes. On 19 February 2007, Miles Cooper was arrested and (on 23 February) appeared in court charged with 12 offences relating to the case. On 27 September, he was found guilty of all 12 charges.
Miles Cooper, a 27-year-old former primary school caretaker from Cherry Hinton near Cambridge in the United Kingdom, was arrested on 19 February 2007 in conjunction with the 2007 letter bombs campaign, as a result of the Operation Hansel investigation.
He appeared in court to answer 12 charges related to the bombings on 23 February 2007. Seven of these charges relate to the seven letter bombs, while the other five relate to the injuries caused by the successful bombs. All of the low-impact explosive devices were sent to state institutions and private companies that Cooper believed were connected to the rise in surveillance society. He pleaded not guilty to the charge of intent to cause injury or death, claiming his actions were designed to draw attention to the issue of authoritarian government. He was convicted on 27 September 2007.
On 28 September 2007, he was sentenced to an indeterminate term in prison. Sentencing him, Judge Julian Hall told Cooper "You are a terrorist, there can be no mistake", and said that he would have to serve 4 years and 149 days before he would be eligible to apply for parole. Judge Hall added "You come across as a quite unemotional young man with little empathy for others."
The police investigation was codenamed Operation Hansel. A number of UK news media reported on 19 February that a man had been arrested in connection with a series of letter bomb attacks.

La Frontera, Chile

La Frontera is the name given to a geographical region in Chile. La Frontera can denote either the area just around Bío Bío River or the whole area between the Bío Bío and Toltén River being in this later definition largely coterminous with the historial usage of Araucanía.
The name comes the times when it was the frontier of the Kingdom of Chile (a part of the Spanish Empire and later the Republic of Chile) with La Araucanía, the lands of the Mapuche nation following their great revolt in 1598.
Following the 1598 revolt and subsequent loss of the cities and forts south of the Bio Bio, the Spanish Empire established a system of forts and fortified towns between the Bio Bio and the Itata River and some within the Mapuche lands of Araucanía itself. This system continued through the 18th century and into the 19th century.
The first fortress rebuilt following the 1599 destruction of the forts in Catirai and its city Santa Cruz de Coya, the cities of Santa María la Blanca de Valdivia, San Andrés de Los Infantes and San Bartolomé de Chillán y Gamboa, was the reconstruction of the city of Chillán by the interim Governor Francisco de Quiñónez.
In 1601 Alonso de Ribera built Fort Talcahuano to defend remaining Spanish settlements near Concepción and Fort Lonquén on the Lonquén River to secure estancias that provided food to the army.
In 1602 Ribera rebuilt the small Fort Colcura and Fort Guanaraque and built a new fort, Santa Fe near the conflunce of the Bio Bio and Vergara Rivers. On the coast Ribera sent captain Francisco Hernández Ortiz to establish a fort Valdivia on the site of the ruined city but it had to be abandoned by the starving remnant of its garrison after a terrible two-year siege.
In 1603 Ribera built Fort Chepe and Fort San Pedro to cover the crossing at the mouth of the Bio Bio River. He rebuilt San Felipe de Araucan and Santa Margarita de Austria on the coast between the aillarehues of Arauco and Tucapel and a fort at Tucapel and Paicavi on the Paicavi River. Also in the same year to the east along the Bio Bio River facing the aillarehues of Catirai and Purén, he rebuilt Santa Lucia de Yumbel and built the forts of Nuestra Señora de la Buena Esperanza, San Rosendo, Nuestra de Senora de Halle, Nacimiento de Nuestro Señor and San Francisco de Borja. The refugees from the abandoned city of Osorno under captain Francisco Hernández founded Fort Calbuco on a channel between the Reloncaví Sound and the Gulf of Ancud.
In 1606, Alonso García de Ramón built Fort San Ignacio de la Redención near Boroa but it was abandoned soon after the ambush of most of its garrison.
In 1607 García de Ramón rebuilt Fort Purén and San Jerónimo de Millapoa but as a result of a peace agreement with the Moluche of Catirai he soon dismantled the later.
In 1611 Luis Merlo de la Fuente built fort "San Luis de Angol" a little to the south of the old city of Angol.
In 1613 Alonso de Ribera built Fort Virguenco in the upper part of the Rehue River and rebuilt the fort at Puren again.
In 1621, Cristóbal de la Cerda y Sotomayor rebuilt the fort of Yumbel the same year it was destroyed. He also built fort San Cristóbal de La Paz and fortified the town around the fort San Bartolomé de Chillán.
In 1622, Pedro Osores de Ulloa built Fort Negrete.
8 March 1626, Luis Fernandez de Cordova established Santa Juana de Guadalcazar.
In 1637, Francisco Laso de la Vega established fort "San Francisco de la Vega" near the ruined site of the city of Angol, abandoning fort "San Luis de Angol".
In 1641, all the Spanish forts south of the Bio Bio were abandoned under the terms of the Peace of Quilín.
In 1647, Martín de Mujica y Buitrón as a result of the Parliament of Quilín (1647) was able to reestablish forts at Valdivia, Santa Juana in 1648, and at Boroa in 1649.
In 1657 Pedro Porter Casanate restored the city of San Bartolomé de Chillán following its destruction at the beginning of the Mapuche Insurrection of 1655. He also built forts San Rafael de Coelemu and San Fabián de Conueo northeast of Concepcion. Meanwhile, captain Alonso de Cordova y Figueroa built Fort Tolpán at the confluence of the Renaico and Vergara Rivers.
In 1661 Governor Porter Casanate built fort "San Miguel Arcángel de Colcura" near modern Lota and a fort at Talcamávida.
In 1662 Ángel de Peredo established a new city of Santa Maria de Guadalupe and repopulated Arauco lost in 1655.
In 1663 Paredo rebuilt fort San Cristóbal de La Paz.
In 1665 Francisco de Meneses Brito established fort San Carlos de Virhuenco on the upper Rehue River and rebuilt forts Nacimiento de Nuestro Señor and Puren.
In 1666 Meneses built fort Santa Fe and Fort de la Encarnación in Repucura. He also rebuilt San Carlos de Austria de Yumbel.
In 1693 Tomás Marín de Poveda rebuilt fort Buena Esperanza de Rere.
In 1694 Marín de Poveda restored Fort de la Encarnación and a Mission in Repucura.
In 1695 Marín de Poveda built fort Santo Tomás de Colhué.
In 1724 Gabriel Cano de Aponte rebuilt forts Nacimiento, Santa Juana de Guadalcázar and Santo Tomás de Colhué. He transferred from Arauco Province the garrison and inhabitants of Plaza de San Diego de Tucapel to the bank of the Laja River near the Andes where a new fort of the same name was built.
In 1739, José Antonio Manso de Velasco founded fort Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles.
In 1749 fort Nacimiento was moved to the present site of the modern town of Nacimiento.
In 1756, Manuel de Amat y Juniet founded fort Santa Bárbara and established the towns of San Rafael de Talcamavida and San Juan Bautista de Gualqui
In 1757 Amat y Juniet made Nacimiento a town.
In 1764 Antonio de Guill y Gonzaga established Fort Repucura and a mission at Repucura once again.
In 1777, the then military engineer Ambrosio O' Higgins, constructed for Agustín de Jáuregui y Aldecoa, a fort San Agustín de Mesamávida.
In 1788 Governor Ambrosio O'Higgins built Fort Príncipe Carlos on the Duqueco River.
In 1792 the forces of Governor Ambrosio O'Higgins under Tomás de Figueroa took possession of the site of the city of Osorno ruined in 1602, and constructed a fort there. O'Higgins reestablished it as a city in 1796.

Psychiatric service dog

Although assistance dogs have traditionally helped people with disabilities such as blindness or more recently deafness or mobility disabilities, there is a wide range of other disabilities that an assistance dog may be able to help with as well, including psychiatric disabilities.
Like all assistance dogs, a psychiatric service dog is individually trained to do work or perform tasks that mitigate their handler's disability.
Training to mitigate a psychiatric disability may include providing environmental assessment (in such cases as paranoia or hallucinations), signaling behaviors (such as interrupting repetitive or injurious behaviors), reminding the handler to take medication, retrieving objects, guiding the handler from stressful situations, or acting as a brace if the handler becomes dizzy.
Psychiatric service dogs may be of any breed or size suitable for public work. Many psychiatric service dogs are trained by the person who will become the handler—usually with the help of a professional trainer. Others are trained by assistance or service dog programs. Assistance dog organizations are increasingly recognizing the need for dogs to help individuals with psychiatric disabilities, and there are even organizations dedicated specifically to supporting psychiatric service dog handlers.
In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual," and therefore allows handlers of psychiatric service dogs the same rights and protections afforded to those with other types of service animals. Service dogs, including psychiatric service dogs, are allowed to accompany their handler in any location that is normally accessible to the public whether or not health codes or business policy normally would allow a dog to enter, provided the dog behaves properly and does not interfere with normal operations (e.g. barking, biting, defecating, or obstructing other people) or pose a direct threat to the safety of others.
An alternative to a psychiatric service dog is an emotional support animal, which may or may not have specific training related to the handler's disability, but provides companionship and emotional support. They do not qualify as service animals in the United States, though they do qualify for several exceptions in housing and air travel.
The Fair Housing Act also allows tenants that have service animals or emotional support animals to stay in housing that does not allow pets. Some individual state laws may also provide additional guidelines or protection.
The Air Carrier Access Act also permits psychiatric service dogs and emotional support animals to be permitted to travel in the cabin when accompanied by a person with a disability.
People with psychiatric service dogs are often faced with several problems that other service dog handlers typically do not experience. While guide dogs for the blind and hearing-impaired and helper dogs for people who use wheelchairs are well-known to the public, dogs for psychiatric conditions are not. Further adding to this issue is that many people with psychiatric conditions do not appear to have anything externally wrong with them, and because of the heavy social stigma of mental illness, the handler may be reluctant to explain their condition or the dog's trained tasks even in the vaguest of terms. In addition, the dogs can be any size (even toy breeds) depending on their trained task, yet there is a common public misconception that all service dogs are medium or large breeds. Any of these issues can lead to other people inappropriately impugning the dog's status or pressing the handler to divulge medical information about themselves.

United Left (East Germany)

The United Left () was an alliance of several leftist opposition groupings in the German Democratic Republic. Among them were Christian Socialists, Trotskyists, adherents of the Titoistic system of self-management and some SED-members, who were critical of their party's policy.
It was founded on October 2, 1989, only a few weeks before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The United Left demanded a reformation of socialism. Its goal was to create a free and democratic GDR. At the end of the year 1989 the party had 1500 members with focal points in Berlin and Halle. In contrast to other East German opposition groups, the United Left was less supported by Western governments and parties. There were also organizational problems and internal controversies between the different ideological tendencies within the United Left. Those are the main reasons the party never gained much attention in politics.
At the first free elections in the GDR in March 1990 the United Left started together with "Die Nelken" ("The Carnations"), a Marxist party. The electoral alliance with the name "Aktionsbündnis Vereinigte Linke" gained 0.18% of the votes and one seat in the Volkskammer. The United Left fell apart in the years after German reunification, but some members were elected into the Bundestag through a party-list by the PDS or The Greens.

Cathedral of Christ the King, Mullingar

Cathedral of Christ the King () is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland. It is situated near the centre of Mullingar next to the Royal Canal, Scoil Mhuire CBS, Mullingar, Coláiste Mhuire, Mullingar and overlooks the local Garda Síochána station on College Street. The cathedral is both the cathedral church of the diocese of Meath and the principal centre of worship in the catholic parish of Mullingar - including parts of counties Meath and Westmeath.
Designed to replace the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (1836-1936), planning commenced in 1920. William Byrne & Sons of Dublin designed the cathedral to be basillican in form and renaissance in style. Its distinctive twin towers, surmounted by bronze crosses, rise to a height of about 55 metres. It was built with a seating capacity of 5,000. Building began in March 1933 and the foundation stone was laid on 6 August of that year by Bishop Thomas Mulvany. Murphy of Dublin were the builders, while much of the artistic decoration work was completed by Earley & Co. of Camden Street, Dublin and Oppenheimer Ltd., of Old Trafford, Manchester. The formal opening and dedication of the new cathedral took place on 6 September 1936. At the request of Pope Pius XI, it became the first cathedral in the world to be dedicated to Christ the King. It was solemnly consecrated on 13 August 1939. The total cost of the building, including decoration was £275,000.
The works of art for which the cathedral is most noted are the mosaics in the chapels of Saint Anne and Saint Patrick. These are the work of the Russian born mosaic artist Boris Anrep, whose work may also be found in Westminster Cathedral.
The Saint Patrick mosaic represents the saint lighting the Paschal fire on the mount of Slane. The principal figure is that of the saint in his apostolic mission, lifting the cross in a vigorous movement, in his other hand holding a torch. The firewood is arranged in a Christogram, signifying the symbolic importance of the fire.
In the Saint Anne mosaic, the name is spelled "Anna". Saint Anne's image is also said to resemble the poet Anna Akhmatova. The mosaic artist (Anrep) had an affair with Akhmatova during World War I. He left Russia before the Bolsheviks seized power, and although he didn’t contact her for 48 years, she remained the muse who haunted his imagination. While she has appeared in several of his mosaics, this one in Mullingar is the only to include her name. (In return, up to 34 of her poems are about him.)

Verrier Elwin

Verrier Elwin (29 August 1902 – 22 February 1964) was an English-born Indian self-trained anthropologist, ethnologist and tribal activist, who began his career in India as a Christian missionary. He was a controversial figure who first abandoned the clergy, to work with Mohandas Gandhi and the Indian National Congress, then converted in Hinduism in 1935 after staying in a Gandhian ashram, and split with the nationalists over what he felt was an overhasty process of transformation and assimilation for the tribals. Elwin is best known for his early work with the Baigas and Gonds of central India, and he married a member of one of the communities he studied there, though he also worked on the tribals of several North East Indian states especially North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) and settled in Shillong later in life, apart from Orissa and Madhya Pradesh.
In time he became an authority on Indian tribal lifestyle and culture, particularly on the Gondi people. He also served as the Deputy Director of the Anthropological Survey of India upon its formation in 1945. Post-independence he took up Indian citizenship. Nehru appointed him as an adviser on tribal affairs for north-eastern India, and later he was Anthropological Adviser to the Government of NEFA (now Arunachal Pradesh).
The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1961. His autobiography, "The Tribal World of Verrier Elwin" won him the 1965 Sahitya Akademi Award in English Language, given by the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters.
Harry Verrier Holman Elwin was born on 29 August 1902 in Dover, the son of Edmund Henry Elwin, Bishop of Sierra Leone. He was educated at Dean Close School and Merton College, Oxford, where he received his degrees of BA First Class in English Language and Literature, MA, and DSc. He also remained the President of Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union (OICCU) in 1925.
In 1926 he was appointed Vice-Principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford and in the following year he became a lecturer at Merton College, Oxford. He went to India in 1927 as a missionary. He first joined Christian Service Society in Pune. The first time he visited the central India, current states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and parts of eastern Maharashtra was with another Indian from Pune, Shamrao Hivale. Their studies are on the tribes are some of the earliest anthropological studies in the country. Over the years he was influenced by the philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. He participated in the Indian independence movement and in 1930 Gandhi said he regarded Elwin as a son.
He came out with numerous works on various tribal groups in India, the best acclaimed being those on Maria and Baigas.
After India attained independence in 1947 he was asked by Jawaharlal Nehru to find solutions to the problems that emerged among the tribal peoples living in the far northeastern corner of India, the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA). NEFA is now the State of Arunachal Pradesh, just north of Assam. He also remained a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy.
The historian Ramachandra Guha's biography "Savaging the Civilized: Verrier Elwin, His Tribals, and India" (1999) brought renewed attention in India to Elwin's life and career.
Verrier Elwin wrote – "The message of the ghotul – that youth must be served, that freedom and happiness are more to be treasured than any material gain, that friendliness and sympathy, hospitality and unity are of the first importance, and above all that human love – and its physical expression – is beautiful, clean and precious, is typically Indian."
Elwin married a Raj Gond tribal girl called Kosi who was a student at his school at Raythwar (Raithwar) in Dindori district in Madhya Pradesh. She was 13 and Verrier 40 at the time of their marriage on 4 April 1940. Elwin made his wife Kosi the subject of his anthropological studies including publishing intimate sexual details in what is called participant observation. They had one son, Jawaharlal (Kumar), born in 1941. Elwin had an ex-parte divorce in 1949, at the Calcutta High Court. He remarried a woman called Leela, belonging to the Pardhan tribe in Patangarh (Pathangad)Chhattisgarh. They had three sons, Wasant Nakul and Ashok. Elwin died in Delhi on 22 February 1964 after a heart attack.

Dagenham Dave

"Dagenham Dave" is a song by Morrissey, released as a single in August 1995, a week prior to the release of "Southpaw Grammar". It was Morrissey's first release on RCA, the label he had signed to after leaving EMI. This was the second Morrissey solo single not to feature the singer on the cover, instead English football coach and former player Terry Venables is pictured sticking out his tongue. Venables was born in Dagenham.
The single reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart.
It is not related to the song of the same name by The Stranglers, from their 1977 album "No More Heroes".
All tracks by Morrissey/Alain Whyte.
"NME" gave a negative review, saying that this single showed that "Morrissey has become the embarrassing incontinent grandfather of Britpop". The song was described as "piss-poor old crap" and a "tune-impaired three-minute drone". Ned Raggett of AllMusic described it as "the least distinct song on the whole album".
However, in other reviews, the opinion was that the song was "very good". It was a unique style which Morrissey had embraced during the height of the Britpop era.
The song was performed live by Morrissey on his 1995 and 1997 tours.

My Beauty

My Beauty is a solo album by Kevin Rowland, lead singer of Dexys Midnight Runners. It was released in 1999, eleven years after his solo debut "The Wanderer". In the interim he had experienced problems with drug addiction. "My Beauty" is an album of cover songs, although Rowland rewrote several of the lyrics to reflect his battles against substance abuse. The album is notorious for its cover, which shows Rowland in drag and heavy make up, an image which Rowland also used during contemporary appearances at the Glastonbury and Reading festivals. During his appearance at Reading he was pelted with bottles thrown by the audience.
The album was supposed to have 12 tracks, but the song "Thunder Road" (written by Bruce Springsteen) was pulled from the album at the last minute because Springsteen refused to approve the lyrical changes made by Rowland. The promo CD distributed (to radio/press) before the official album had all twelve tracks.
The album was released on Creation Records, on the initiative of label boss Alan McGee, who was a fan of Rowland's work. Upon release, the album received mixed reviews. It has been reported that the album was one of Creation's lowest selling albums, shifting only 500 copies, but in fact the album actually sold over 20,000 worldwide.

Technora

Technora is an aramid that is useful for a variety of applications that require high strength or chemical resistance. It is a brand name of the company Teijin. It was also used to suspend the NASA Mars rover Opportunity from its parachute during descent.
Technora is produced by condensation polymerization of terephthaloyl chloride (TCl) with a mixture of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and 3,4'-diaminodiphenylether (3,4'-ODA). The polymer is closely related to Teijin's Twaron or DuPont's Kevlar. Technora is derived from two different diamines, 3,4'-ODA and PPD, whereas Twaron is derived from PPD alone. This relatively simple process uses only one amide solvent, and therefore spinning can be done directly after the polymer production.

St Mary's Priory Church, Deerhurst

St Mary's Priory Church, Deerhurst, near Gloucester, England, is unusual in that it contains many elaborate Anglo-Saxon details, including carvings and sculpture. At the beginning of the 9th century land was granted to Deerhurst, and it is generally accepted that significant work was carried out during the 9th and 10th centuries. This makes the church contemporary with the Carolingian Renaissance on the continent, which may have provided the artistic impetus.
There is a second important Anglo-Saxon building in the village, Odda's Chapel, lying about 200 yards south-west of the church
The lower half of the church tower has stonework laid in herringbone fashion, and above is of later construction with quoins. The lower part of the tower is unusually divided into two separate compartments.
On the second floor there is a western arched doorway with a square hood-mould and beast's head above. This doorway possibly provided access onto an outside gallery. At this level, on the eastern side of the tower, there is an elaborately carved double triangular-headed opening into the nave with stylised capitals and fluted pilasters with reeded decoration.
Below, at first floor level, there is a blocked-up doorway, positioned off-centre, which most likely provided access to a gallery in the nave. Corbels just below this doorway tend to justify this argument. A triangular window is also cut into the east wall of the tower and each of the nave side walls at this level.
The role of the western tower at first floor level can be appreciated by looking at the significance of "westworks" in Carolingian churches. Westworks contained an altar at first floor level, and access was provided by flanking staircase towers. To the south of the tower is a later medieval spiral staircase. This used to lead to the second floor of the tower. The original staircase may have been housed within the tower. The twin staircase tower arrangement only occurred in the larger Anglo-Saxon churches in England (e.g. possibly Winchester and Canterbury), which have now been lost. Deerhurst may have housed an altar similarly to the Carolingian arrangement, and this would account for the positioning of the door to the side and the triangular window, if the altar was located at the centre.
At ground floor level, the entrance to the church has been retained at the west door and through the tower, which originally was the traditional entrance for a church. The present west doorway has replaced the original, but a beast's head above still remains. Over the inner doorway, before entering the church proper, is a sculpture of the Virgin and Child. Beast's head label-stops with spiral decoration have been moved from outside to the inner doorway, and others occur at the chancel arch at the end of the nave. The apse has been demolished and the arch blocked-up. Other Anglo-Saxon sculpture includes the "Deerhust Angel" on the outside of the south wall of what was originally part of the apse. There is also a rare Anglo-Saxon font in the north aisle, which is decorated with spirals and vine scrolls.
Composer George Butterworth, MC (12 July 1885 – 5 August 1916) is commemorated with a plaque.
The churchyard contains war graves of two soldiers of World War I.

Tunnel of Love (Dire Straits song)

"Tunnel of Love" is a 1980 rock song by Dire Straits. It appears on the album "Making Movies", and subsequently on the live albums ' and "Live at the BBC" and the greatest hits albums "Money for Nothing", ', and "".
It reached the position of only #54 in the UK Singles Chart upon its single release in October 1981, despite being one of the band's most famous and popular songs. Two music videos exist for the song, one depicting Mark Knopfler, John Illsley and Pick Withers performing on a blank set, intercut with imagery and actors relevant to the lyrics, the other featuring a larger band arrangement and telling the story of a couple escaping a group of soldiers who chase them from a funfair.
The Spanish City in the song was a fairground located in Whitley Bay, part of the North Sea coast to the north-east of Newcastle upon Tyne, one train stop along from Cullercoats as mentioned in the song. The term "Rockaway" references Rockaway Beach in New York City, the location of the Rockaways' Playland amusement park. In 1980s concerts, Dire Straits played the central theme of The Animals' "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" during an extended instrumental introduction to the song, as Knopfler talked about that group's hometown of Newcastle. Knopfler's outro solo has received numerous plaudits over the years:
""Throughout "Tunnel of Love," Mark Knopfler dramatizes this close encounter by using his guitar as a Greek chorus. [...] Later, as Knopfler walks alone through the "carousel and the carnival arcades," waiting for another night and another girl, he wraps his voice like a ratty old raincoat around Bittan's gently tinkling piano and the long guitar solo that ends the track. Somehow, the evocative moan of the artist's guitar suggests a truth much deeper than the carnival-as-life metaphor has revealed.""
"Tunnel of Love" is one of only three Dire Straits songs not credited to Mark Knopfler alone (the other two are "Money for Nothing" and "What's The Matter Baby?"). The song itself is entirely by Knopfler, but the opening instrumental is an arrangement of the "Carousel Waltz" from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Carousel".
Mark Knopfler also sometimes played melody from chorus of Stop! In the Name of Love by The Supremes as an additional intro prior to the "Carousel Waltz" while performing this song live.
The song is referred to in the novel "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" by Douglas Adams: "Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff drink."
It was used in the 1982 film "An Officer and a Gentleman". The song is sampled in John Legend's "I Love, You Love" on his 2008 "Evolver" album. The English folk duo Show of Hands recorded a cover version of this song on their 2011 album "Covers 2".

Mario Gallo (director)

Mario Gallo (July 31, 1878 - 1945) was an Italian born Argentine film director of the 1900s and 1910s and one of the earliest directors in the Cinema of Argentina. He directed what is nowadays considered the first fiction feature movie, "El Fusilamiento de Dorrego", now lost.
Born in Barletta, Apulia, southern Italy, Gallo arrived in Argentina in 1905 and began directing in 1909 "El Fusilamiento de Dorrego", which he presented a year later. Argentine cinema had so far consisted of shorts depicting parts of Buenos Aires and even a documental by Eugène Py, in 1900, but Gallo's film was the first to be a feature work of fiction. In later years, Gallo claimed to have filmed other films first, all equally lost and of which remained no evidence. Gallo's films consisted of short glimpses of reenacted Argentine history - historical events, myths and battles.
He died at Buenos Aires in 1945.

I've been working on this in little spurts for a while. Given that it's a fairly new car, I think pretty much all that can be said about it is there, except perhaps for production/sales data which I hope will become available in the next few months. It's mostly prose, contains no bullet points or tables, has free images except for two concept vehicles where I've justified their fair use, is extensively referenced and wikilinked, etc etc. I think it's material (though too short for anything more), but I've been told peer reviewed articles have a better chance of achieving this. Any feedback welcome, although of course fawning praise is always preferred... "-- 12:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)"

Gupta Technologies

Gupta Technologies, LLC, taken over by Unify Corporation in 2006, is a software development company whose principal products are the SQL relational database "SQLBase", a mobile HTML5 enterprise development system called TD Mobile and a Rapid application development system called "Team Developer" (also known as "SQLWindows"). The company is considered as the provider of the world's first client/server relational database software that would run on Personal Computers (PC) rather than Mini Computers.
It was founded in 1984 by Umang Gupta, a former Vice President and General Manager of the Microcomputer Products Division at Oracle Corporation. Gupta's first product was SQLBase, followed by SQLWindows, which combined SQLBase with a graphical user interface and programming language for creating business applications. SQLWindows was one of the first GUI development tools for Microsoft Windows. The company went public in 1993 (NASDAQ: GPTA).
The name of the company was changed to Centura Software in the late 1990s. In February 2001 Centura was taken over by the Platinum Equity investment company. Centura Software filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in August 2001, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission revoked the registration of Centura's common stock in December 2004. After the bankruptcy, some assets were kept by a reborn Gupta Technologies LLC. In January 2005 Gupta Technologies, LLC was bought by another investor, "Warp Technology Holdings, Inc." In May 2005 the company changed its name to "Halo Technology Holdings, Inc." In September 2006 the company was acquired by Unify Corporation. In June 2010 Unify announced its merger with "Daegis", a US company that provides software for electronic discovery in litigation matters.
In November 2012 the Unify database and development tools division was renamed back to Gupta Technologies.
Gupta's headquarters are in Roseville, California.
In the middle of the 1990s Gupta achieved a worldwide business volume about 60 million US Dollar with 500 employees. Since then company development has regressed. Unify employs only about 70 people, who run, apart from Gupta, a number of other lines of product and service. The overall revenue from software licences was 4.4 million US Dollar in 2007.
Most clients use the Team Developer 4GL development environment with other relational databases. In the workgroup segment and in mobile applications Gupta’s own database "SQLBase" is used quite often. "SQLBase" is targeted towards small PC applications and handheld devices such as handheld PCs. Since Unify took over Gupta Technologies, many new product versions of SQLBase and Team Developer have been released.
TD Mobile is a development system for mobile enterprise apps utilizing HTML5 and JavaScript technologies. TD Mobile apps do run on all mobile devices that support HTML5. Those include Android based smartphones and tablets, iOS based smartphones and tablets, Windows phone and Blackberry as well.
Apps are designed in a visual page editor, the fronted side requires no coding in HTML or JavaScript. TD Mobile offers a unique approach in that it allows to develop the client app and the backend code in one single development system.

Sunny (Morrissey song)

"Sunny" is a song by Morrissey, released as a single in December 1995. It was released by EMI to try to cash in on Morrissey's "Southpaw Grammar" album that had been released that year by RCA and consisted of three songs that Morrissey had recorded while under contract to EMI.
"Sunny" had initially been planned to appear on the "Boxers" single released in January 1995, and "Black-Eyed Susan" had at one point been allocated to be the B-side of "The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get" in 1994.
Jack Rabid of AllMusic described Sunny as "pleasant, breezy, jovial, and winsome, but the melody is not memorable." He expressed a preference for the B-sides: "As has been the case for Morrissey's whole career, the B-sides overshadow the A-side."
The song was performed live by Morrissey between 1995 and 2000.

Jack Sels

Jean-Jacques (Jack) Sels (29 January 1922 – 21 March 1970) was a Belgian jazz saxophonist, arranger and composer. He is now considered to be one of the most remarkable Belgian post-war jazz saxophonists. Although he left only a few records, he was definitely an influential figure for the Belgian scene.
Jack Sels grew up in Antwerp. As a teenager he started collecting jazz records. Due to a substantial inheritance from his father his collection grew to about 10,000 records, but it was destroyed during a Second World War bombing. After first having studied piano he taught himself playing the tenor saxophone. To earn a living, he worked in an ice cream parlour in the Antwerp Hoogstraat (High Street) and spent much time listening to his jazz idols, among them the tenor saxophonist Lester Young, trumpeters Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie and alto saxophonist Charlie Parker. After the Second World War many American and Canadian soldiers arrived in the port of Antwerp and Jack Sels loved to talk to them and listen to the new records they brought with them from the United States. It also enabled him to further expand his record collection.
The arrival of Dizzy Gillespie’s big band at Antwerp in 1948 made a lasting impression on Jack Sels and he decided to start his own big band for which he would also write the music. The band made an impressive debut with some of the best musicians of that time. On trumpet: Paul Heyndrickx, Charlie Knegtel, Theo Mertens, Herman and Nick Sandy Fissette; on trombone: Nat Peck, Frans Van Dijk, Jan Mertens and Christian Kellens; on Sax: Jay Cameron, Marcel Peeters, Gene Verstrepen, Bobby Jaspar and Roger Asselberghs plus Jean Warland on bass, Francis Coppieters on piano, John Ward on drums, Rudy Frankel on conga and Vilez Bill on bongo drum. But because of financial and other problems it was hard for him to hold such a big band together. In 1951, he formed a smaller band with 15 musicians, modelled after his idol Miles Davis, and later a still smaller group with which he toured in Germany. Back in Belgium, in 1954, he recorded six tracks in boogy style for Ronnex Records and performed on stage with Nat King Cole.
In 1955 he composed the soundtrack for the movie "Meeuwen Sterven in de Haven" (Seagulls Die in the Harbour) by Roland Verhavert. From 1958 on he worked on radio programs for the NIR, the later BRT radio, and on behalf of the Adult Education department of the Ministry of Culture, he toured through Flanders to promote jazz music. In 1958 he played with his group at the World Exhibition in Brussels.
Although Jack Sels played with jazz legends like Dizzy Gillespie, Lester Young, Lou Bennett and Kenny Clarke, his fame did not spread worldwide because of his choice to stay in Antwerp. But even though he did not get an international breakthrough, he was always kept in great esteem by jazz connoisseurs and the musicians he played with.
The last three years of his life his health declined, making it very difficult for him to play. He suffered a heart attack in his Antwerp home and died on 21 March 1970.
Sels didn't record much. Most of the 78rpm and LPs are impossible to find. Although Jack Sels played with jazz legends like Dizzy Gillespie, Lester Young, Lou Bennett and Kenny Clarke, his fame did not spread worldwide because of his choice to stay in Antwerp. But even though he did not get an international breakthrough, he was always kept in great esteem by jazz connoisseurs and the musicians he played with.
His music has been played and recorded by a.o. Johnny Griffin and the Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band.
The Belgian movie "Just Friends" (by Marc-Henri Wajnberg, 1993) was inspired by the unique figure of Sels.
In 2003 a play was staged in Belgium by Theater Antigone; "het Jack Sels Project".

<doc id="9364774" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9364774" title="Chitrakote Falls">
Chitrakote Falls

The Chitrakote Falls (alternative spellings "Chitrakoot"; "Chitrakot"; ) is a natural waterfall located to the west of Jagdalpur, in Bastar district in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh on the Indravati River. It is located at a distance of to the west of Jagdalpur.
The height of the falls is about . It is the widest fall in India, Because of its width and wide spread during the monsoon season, it is often called the Niagara Falls of India.
The Chitrakote Falls is located on the Indravati River. The river originates in the kalahandi region of Orissa, in the Vindhya Range of hills, flows westward and then forms a fall at Chitrakote, enters Andhra Pradesh and finally flows into the Godavari River, after traversing in the state, at Bhadrakali.
The free drop of the falls is a sheer height of about . Because of its horseshoe shape, it is compared with the Niagara Falls and is given the sobriquet ‘the Small Niagara Falls’. During the rainy season, from July and October, rainbows are created with sun rays reflecting on mist from the waterfall.
On the left bank of the Chitakoot Falls, a small Hindu shrine dedicated to the god Shiva and several naturally created grottos named "Parvati caves" (named after Shiva's wife Parvati) are located. The weather in the area is generally pleasant except in the summer season when it is hot due to absence of vegetation in the area.
The river flows sluggishly on the upstream side of the falls due to its meandering nature as it drains through the plains of Jagadalpur. This reach of the river valley has very little forest cover. Below the falls the river traverses the Bodhghat forested area and the river regime undergoes drastic change in its flow conditions. Aeration process and the forest in the downstream area filters the silt in the river.
Chitakoot Falls is one of the two of the waterfalls located in the Kanger Valley National Park, the other is Tirathgarh falls.
The geological formation of the Indravati River valley as it rises and flows downstream consists of quartzitic sandstone and changes to the Archaean granite and gneisses near the Chitrakote Falls. It is one of the six waterfalls in India which is classified as a geomorphosites/geoheritage site, geomorphological landforms under the category of natural waterfalls; this classification is based on research studies carried out by geologists on ancient geological features of heritage value existing in different parts of the country. Geomorphosite/geoheritage sites are ancient geological sites of scientific, cultural and socio-economic significance. These have been studied and discussed in seminars by geologists, and studies have received the support of international institutions such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), and the International Association of Geomorphologists (IAG).
The Chitrakote Falls, which spreads over three braids during the low flow season, is a single sheet of flow over a free fall of about forming a horseshoe shaped gorge. However, during the monsoon season, when the Indravati River is in floods, the falls cover the entire stretch of the horseshoe from the left to the right bank covering a width of about . Though it is about one third less in width compared to that of the Niagara Falls, its visual splendour is described as equally impressive. Water flow conditions over the falls vary with the seasons. During the flood season or the monsoon season, the flow is filled with silt. It is India's widest waterfall.
Local boat facilities operating below and under the falls in a misty atmosphere provide views of the falls under an early morning sun in reflected sun light and in a blue hue. On the banks of the pond below the falls, many small Shiva Lingas (aniconic symbols of the god Shiva) are found in several niches, as are iron trishuls (the trident weapon of Shiva), mostly in a rusted state. On the left bank, there is a rock ledge and climbing down this cliff leads to a naturally formed niche which houses stone slabs carved with deities. In addition, there is a small hut made of straw where Shiva images and rusted images of his son, the god Ganesha are seen. Local people are involved in fishing in the area.
The beauty of falls is seen throughout the year, particularly during sunset. As the fast flowing water of the river flows over the sharp near vertical rock exposure at the widest reach of the river, it generates misty clouds and then hits into a pond formed in a semicircular shape at the bottom of the falls. Adventure sports enthusiasts use boats in the stormy part of this pond. Pilgrims bathe in the calmer part of the lake. In the low flow season, paddle boats are used in pools formed in the upstream part of the falls. In the pool below the falls, swimming is permitted and paddle boats are permitted. Local boatmen can paddle their boats under the spray below the falls.
Apart from many large hydro electric power plants on the Indravati river, a small power plant of 7.5 MW capacity has been planned to utilize the head at the Chitrakote falls, though no irrigation is envisaged.
Some terrorist activity by Maoists (anti-revisionist) was reported in the area. In 2008, when the then President of India Pratibha Patil visited Chitrakote Falls, there was a violent attack on a police vehicle which was blown up.
The Ministry of Tourism and Development of the Government of India had assessed the potential of this site in 2003 as of a natural "ambience" suitable for development of eco-tourism. Based on this assessment, plans were drawn up to develop facilities such as local restaurants, nature camping sites, a playground for children and platforms to view the falls, and also to improve the road condition, fix signs along the road from Jagadlapur to the falls, and beautify the site. Environmental conditions in the vicinity of the falls are in a preserved state but need attention as eco-tourism develops. As of 2010, some infrastructure facilities had improved. There is a government run hotel at the top of the fall. A series of steps from the garden of the hotel leads to the falls. "Chitrakote Log huts" with basic and modern cabins have also been built at the location. Some of the cabins provide views of the falls.

Manikuntala Sen

Manikuntala Sen ()(c. 1911–1987) was one of the first women to be active in the Communist Party of India. She is best known for her Bengali-language memoir "Shediner Kotha" (published in English as "In Search of Freedom: An Unfinished Journey"), in which she describes her experiences as a woman activist during some of the most turbulent times in India's history.
Manikuntala Sen was born in Barisal in what is now Bangladesh, an area known for the activities of the nationalist jatra playwright Mukunda Das. Ashwini Kumar Dutta, a prominent nationalist leader and educationist, was a friend of the family and an early influence on her, as was Jagadish Chandra Mukhopadhyay, principal of Brajamohan College, then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, where Manikuntala Sen got her BA degree; Mukhopadhyay especially encouraged her to develop her mind. Sen met Gandhi when he visited Barishal in 1923, and was particularly impressed by the way he exhorted a group of prostitutes to work towards liberation. The family stopped wearing imported fabrics and patronised the Bangalakshmi Mills, owned and run by Indians and an icon of the nationalist movement. Barishal was then a hotbed of revolutionary politics, with the extremist Anushilan Samiti very active. Sen took up teaching at a girls' school where she met Shantisudha Ghosh, a member of the Jugantar party, whose circle read and shared the writings of Marx and Lenin. Initially sceptical, Sen became more and more influenced by their ideas, even more so when she saw Shantisudha Ghosh taken in for questioning and harassed by the police. Sen persuaded her family to allow her to go to Calcutta to complete her studies and, she secretly hoped, to make contact with the Communist Party.
At that time Hindu bhadralok communities in Bengal were more liberal about sending their daughters long distances to study further; Sen found herself part of a group of young girls like herself living in the city for the first time. She stayed in a hostel and soon got over her initial awe at being in the big city. The conservatism and narrowmindedness of the established families she sometimes encountered rather disgusted her, and she also writes with remarkable frankness for her time about the harassment that she and her friends often faced from men. Through her friend Bimalpratibha Devi she became acquainted with leaders of the Mahila Shakti Sangha and several prominent Congress women; this nurtured her nascent feminism and inspired her to think about the need for change in women's position in society. She made contact with Soumyendranath Tagore's Revolutionary Communist Party of India. The 'real' Communist Party of India, part of the Third International was then underground, and after much searching she eventually discovered that its headquarters were in fact in Barishal.
Sen's parents were initially ambivalent about her involvement with the party, as it was then regarded as a dangerous group of rebels wanted by the authorities, but shortly after she became a communist in 1939, Sen took her mother to a meeting addressed by Biswanath Mukherjee. His impassioned speech converted her mother to the cause and for a few days she could talk of nothing else. Sen took the opportunity to ask that she be allowed to travel (alone in the company of young male activists) to another meeting. Reluctantly she was given permission. Living on a nominal party stipend, from 1942 Sen began to travel the country, staying in small villages and addressing the people. She describes how the men would shun her because she was a woman, and the women, in purdah, stayed away because she was a 'leader' and the equivalent of a man. Much patience and tact were required to overcome this barrier.
The year 1943 saw a devastating famine sweep over Bengal, caused by the loss of Burmese rice and the dislocations of war. A cyclone also devastated part of Midnapore district. Sen began relief work there and spent most of the war years travelling the districts helping destitute women. In 1947 India attained Independence; a few months later the Communist Party of India was outlawed and Sen was jailed in 1948. She remained in custody till 1951, and was released to find the Party embroiled in controversy and her beloved Barishal now part of East Pakistan. She withdrew somewhat from the ideological debates dividing Indian communism and increased her work for various feminist organisations such as the Women's International Democratic Federation and the All India Women's Conference. She had come to realise that the Party had integral biases against women and that she would not rise in its hierarchy. Around this time she met her future husband, the Kashmiri Jolly Kaul, also a Party activist. She was elected to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Kalighat constituency in 1952, campaigned for the Hindu Code Bill and clashed with rightwing leaders such as Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
The war with China in 1962 brought to a head the various disagreements in the Communist Party of India, and led to a split, with the Indian government conducting a short-lived crackdown on those who continued to support China. Kaul and Sen were unable to bear the thought of choosing between the CPI and the new Communist Party of India. Kaul resigned, and though Sen stayed within the party she withdrew from active participation. The couple moved to Delhi but returned within a few years to Calcutta, where Sen died on 11 September 1987.

Italian ironclad Enrico Dandolo

Enrico Dandolo was the second of two turret ships built for the Italian "Regia Marina" (Royal Navy) in the 1870s. They were fitted with the largest guns available, 17.72 in (450 mm) rifled, muzzle-loading guns, and were the largest, fastest and most powerful ships of their day. "Enrico Dandolo" was built in La Spezia, with her keel laid in January 1873 and her hull launched in July 1878. Construction was finally completed in April 1882 when the ship, named for the 42nd Doge of Venice, was commissioned into the Italian fleet.
"Enrico Dandolo" spent much of her career in the Active Squadron of the Italian fleet, primarily occupied with training exercises. She was heavily modernized in 1895–98, receiving a new battery of fast-firing guns in place of the old 17.72 in guns. The ship served in the Reserve Squadron after 1905, and then became a gunnery training ship. During the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12, "Enrico Dandolo" was among the few ships of the Italian fleet to see no action. She was employed as a harbor defense ship, first in Tobruk, Libya in 1913 and then in Brindisi and Venice during World War I. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1920.
"Enrico Dandolo" was long overall and had a beam of and an average draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical compound steam engines each driving a single screw propeller, with steam supplied by eight coal-fired, rectangular boilers. Her engines produced a top speed of at . She could steam for at a speed of . She had a crew of 420 officers and men, which later increased to 515.
"Enrico Dandolo" was armed with a main battery of four 20-caliber guns, mounted in two turrets placed "en echelon" amidships. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she carried three torpedo tubes. "Enrico Dandolo" was protected by belt armor that was thick at its strongest section, which protected the ship's magazines and machinery spaces. Both ends of the belt were connected by transverse bulkheads that were thick. She had an armored deck that was thick. Her gun turrets were armored with of steel plate. The ship's bow and stern were not armored, but they were extensively subdivided into a cellular "raft" that was intended to reduce the risk of flooding.
"Enrico Dandolo", named after Enrico Dandolo, the 42nd Doge of Venice, was laid down at La Spezia on 6 January 1873 and was launched on 10 July 1878. Fitting-out work was completed on 11 April 1882. During the annual fleet maneuvers held in 1885, "Enrico Dandolo" served as the flagship of the 1st Division of the "Western Squadron", with Vice Admiral Martini commanding. She was joined by her sister , the protected cruiser , and a sloop. The "Western Squadron" attacked the defending "Eastern Squadron", simulating a Franco-Italian conflict, with operations conducted off Sardinia. During the following year's fleet maneuvers, which began on 10 June, "Enrico Dandolo" was assigned to the "defending squadron", along with the ironclads , , and , the protected cruiser , the torpedo cruiser , and several smaller vessels. The first half of the maneuvers tested the ability to attack and defend the Strait of Messina, and concluded in time for a fleet review by King Umberto I on the 21st. The second phase consisted of joint maneuvers with the Italian Army; the fleet was tasked with attempting to force an amphibious landing, which it effected at San Vicenzo on 30 July, the last day of the exercises.
"Enrico Dandolo" took part in the annual 1888 fleet maneuvers, along with the ironclads , , "Caio Duilio", and , one protected cruiser, four torpedo cruisers, and numerous smaller vessels. The maneuvers consisted of close-order drills and a simulated attack on and defense of La Spezia. The ship served as the flagship of the 3rd Division of the Active Squadron during the 1893 fleet maneuvers, along with the ironclad , the torpedo cruiser , and four torpedo boats. During the maneuvers, which lasted from 6 August to 5 September, the ships of the Active Squadron simulated a French attack on the Italian fleet. For the rest of the year, "Enrico Dandolo" was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Italian fleet, along with the protected cruiser and the torpedo cruiser .
She was thoroughly reconstructed between 1895 and 1898 to a design created by Inspector Engineer Giacinto Pulino. The ship's old, slow-firing 17.7 in guns were replaced with new quick-firing guns, and she received a new secondary battery to defend the ship against torpedo boats. The battery consisted of five 40-caliber guns, sixteen 43-caliber quick-firing guns, eight 20-caliber revolver cannon, and four machine guns. The main battery guns were placed in significantly smaller turrets that had of armor plating; the lighter guns and turrets reduced the ship's displacement to normally and at full load. "Enrico Dandolo" also received a new engine, though her performance remained the same. The ship's crew increased to 495.
In 1901, "Enrico Dandolo" was joined in the 2nd Division by the ironclads and , the armored cruiser , "Partenope", and three torpedo boats. She remained in service in the Active Squadron the following year, with "Andrea Doria", "Francesco Morosini", the three s, and the new pre-dreadnought battleship . In 1905, "Enrico Dandolo" was transferred to the Reserve Squadron, along with the three s and the three "Re Umberto"s, three cruisers, and sixteen torpedo boats. This squadron only entered active service for two months of the year for training maneuvers, and the rest of the year was spent with reduced crews. She thereafter served in the Gunnery School as a training ship, along with the torpedo cruiser .
At the start of the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12, "Italia" was assigned to the 5th Division of the Italian fleet, the ironclads and , but she saw no action during the conflict. She became the guardship at Tobruk, Libya in 1913 and was transferred to Brindisi and Venice during World War I. While stationed at Brindisi, six of her 37 mm guns were removed. She was stricken on 23 January 1920 and later broken up for scrap.

East Lancashire derby

The East Lancashire Derby also known as the "Cotton Mills Derby" is a football match between Blackburn Rovers F.C. and Burnley F.C.. The nickname originates from the fact that Blackburn and Burnley were former mill towns.
The first ever competitive league match between these two former English football champions and founder members of the Football League, took place at Turf Moor on 3 November 1888, Blackburn won the game 7–1. Blackburn also won the return fixture at Ewood Park 4–2. From a town standpoint there is an obvious geographical reason for the rivalry as the two Lancashire towns only lie 11 miles (18 km) apart. Accrington Stanley F.C. stands in the middle, but is not taken seriously as a rival by either. Another alleged reason for the increased hostilities is that Blackburn complained to the Football League about Burnley's illegal number of Scottish players in the 1890s.
Blackburn Rovers were founded in 1875 and in the following years, many other clubs were formed in the region such as Accrington F.C. in 1886 and Clitheroe Central in 1877, due to football being passionately taken up by the area. Another such club was Burnley Rovers, who started out as a rugby club until changing codes in 1882.
The two clubs met for the first time at Turf Moor on 27 September in front of a 5,000 crowd, Rovers emerging as 4–2 winners. Burnley quickly gained revenge when they won 5–1 on the same ground the following March. Their first meeting in Blackburn took place at Leamington Road and ended all square at 2–2.
These early pre-league ‘friendlies’ were keenly contested affairs, with considerable pride at stake, and there was a refreshing informality in the way they were played and covered by the press. Rovers’ goalscorer in the next match against Burnley was ‘unknown’, some matches were conducted with 10 men and as much as 10 years later in the league itself, two Burnley goals in successive season against Blackburn were credited to ‘Scrimmage’.
The total number of pre-league meetings between the clubs was 13, with Burnley winning seven, Blackburn four and the other two being drawn.
Blackburn Rovers and Burnley were among the original 12 members of the Football league and took their places in the inaugural season, which was to be dominated by fellow Lancashire side Preston North End, who completed the league and cup double.
As far as Blackburn and Burnley were concerned there was only one dominant force, as over the first four seasons, before the league was split into two divisions, Blackburn performed the double over the Clarets in each of the initial three seasons scoring plenty of goals in the process. Their first league match against each other was at Turf Moor and produced a 7–1 win for Blackburn and the very next season they won the home fixture by the same margin; Burnley remain the only team Blackburn have beaten home and away by this score line to this day.
The next season of 1890–91 was not much better for Burnley as Rovers managed to score both five and a six in the fixture. The main figure in these defeats was Jack Southworth, who scored 12 goals in his 10 appearances against Burnley, including Rovers’ first ever hat-trick in the league which came in the 7–1 away win of 1888–89. To this day, no-one in official fixtures between the clubs has matched his goal tally.
Burnley finally recorded their first league victory over Rovers on 12 December 1891. However, it was in circumstances that were controversial.
In driving snow and wind, Burnley had stormed to a three-goal interval lead at Turf Moor. Emerging for the second half, the Rovers players seemed disinclined to proceed with the contest and their lack of enthusiasm increased considerably when Lofthouse was sent off along with Burnley’s Stewart after a brief altercation, and the rest of the Rovers outfield players went with him! This left the entire Burnley side against Herbie Arthur, Rovers’ goalkeeper who appealed for offside as Burnley bore down on his goal. The referee wisely abandoned the farce and the points were awarded to Burnley.
The next season saw the start of the old First Division and their first meeting in it was goalless: the first of only six matches that have ended that way between them in 89 league and cup pairings. Rovers continued to have the better of the fixture, registering five consecutive wins at Ewood between 1892–97, which still stands as the record number of straight wins on one ground between the clubs. Burnley’s brightest moment came at Turf Moor in 1895–96 when they won the season’s final game 6–0 with Nicol scoring a hat-trick, the first and last by a Burnley player against Rovers in official competition.
The clubs were temporarily parted by Burnley’s relegation in 1896–97 which was assisted by Rovers completing the double over them, something they have done nine times to Burnley’s seven.
Their next meetings were destined to be in the notorious Test match series at the end of 1897–98 season. The forerunner of the current play-offs, these were used to determine the composition of the First Division for the next season.
Rovers had finished next to bottom while Burnley had won the Second Division at the first time of asking. They beat Rovers twice in these matches, Wilf Toman scoring in both with a hat-trick in the first. The controversy arose when Burnley met Stoke for the second time as both sides needed to draw to ensure First Division football.
The resultant 0–0 draw was known as the ‘game without a shot’ and questions were asked about each side’s commitment to winning the match. The powers-that-be decided to extend the First Division anyway and so that Test match series proved meaningless and Blackburn, along with Newcastle United, survived.
Burnley won three of the next four games between the clubs before their relegation at the turn of the century meant that it was to be 13 years before the rivals met again in official competition.
English Test Match
League
Between 1915 and 1919 the league was suspended due to the First World War. When the War ended, the Blackburn v Burnley fixture would enjoy 11 uninterrupted years in the top flight.
Burnley experienced initial dominance, winning the league in 1920–21 and doing the double over Rovers in successive seasons before Rovers returned the favour in 1921–22. The mid-20s saw three hat-tricks in two seasons by Rovers players against the old foe; those were from John McIntyre, Arthur Rigby and Ted Harper in his record-breaking season of 1925–26 when he found the net 43 times in 37 league games, a Rovers record that still stands today.
The meetings came to an end in the 1929–30 season when Burnley were relegated to Division 2. The two clubs would not meet again until Blackburn joined them in the second tier in 1935–36.
The teams met for the first time in the Second Division on 24 October 1936 in a rare goalless draw. Rovers won the return 3–1 and Jack Bruton scored against his old club in that game and at Ewood again in the next season. He remains the only man to have scored for both clubs against the other, having netted twice for Burnley against Rovers in the 1920s back in the Division One. Rovers won the Second Division Championship in 1938–39 and honours had ended even in their three-year sojourn of Second Division football when the Second World War arrived and the league was suspended between the 1939–40 seasons and 1945–46.
Burnley won promotion when the league was restarted in 1946–47, when they also reached the FA Cup final, to give another season of First Division matches between the clubs. Burnley taking three of the four points was indicative of differing fortunes to come, with the Clarets consolidating their arrival in Division One by finishing third while Rovers were relegated.
It was to be another 11 years before Rovers last-gasp promotion bid in 1957–58 brought another unbroken eight years of competition in the top flight.
By this time a Burnley side, patiently developed on defensive principles, was beginning to find an attacking flair too and they won eight and drew three of the 16 meetings between the clubs in this period. It was particularly galling for the Ewood faithful to lose four years in a row at home, especially as it culminated in Rovers relegation in 1965–66.
When Burnley were relegated in 1970–71 another meeting might have been on the cards, but Rovers went down to the Third Division in the same season and avoided the possibility. Burnley returned to the First Division two years later but upon relegation in 1975–76 they rejoined Rovers who had been promoted in 1974–75, in the Second Division for three years of matches.
Burnley definitely had the edge, winning four of the six matches, the popular midfielder Peter Noble scoring in four of the games. Rovers went down again at the end of the 1978–79 season, but bounced straight back while Burnley moved into the opposite direction entering the Third Division for the first time at the end of 1979–80.
Burnley won promotion at the second time of asking in 1981–82 to set up a renewal of the fixture. The games in 1982–83 would ultimately prove to be the last between them in the 20th century.
Rovers did the double over Burnley; Simon Garner was to play the part of hero/villain by scoring all Rovers three goals in the two games, two of which came from the penalty spot. It was left to Derek Scott to register the last league goal Burnley scored against Rovers for the next 26 years.
In the following 27 years both clubs had very different fortunes. Burnley were relegated to the Third division at the end of the 1982–83 season quickly followed by relegation to the Fourth division in the 1984–85 season. Both clubs would stay in their respective divisions until 1991–92 when Blackburn were promoted to the newly formed Premier league and Burnley were promoted to the third tier of English football which had been renamed Division 2. Burnley were promoted again in the 1993–94 season to the First Division but were relegated the following year. This season also saw Blackburn win the Premier League to further confound the Burnley fans misery.
Blackburn became the first and to this day only, Premier League winners to be relegated in the 1998–99 season and were joined by Burnley in Division One when they were promoted at the end of the 1999–2000 season.
The league meetings between the clubs occurred in the 2000–01 season when Rovers did the double over Burnley on their way to promotion to the Premiership.
The first meeting of the new millennium between them was at Turf Moor on 16 December. A very predictably bitter encounter went the way of Rovers with goals from Jason McAteer and Marcus Bent, Burnley’s chances ending with the sending off of Kevin Ball. There were a few unpleasant scenes after the game, which some media observers deemed a ‘riot’ and a throwback to earlier scenes of football violence 20 years ago or more.
Rovers made short work of Burnley, in the game at Ewood where the Clarets were cast as April fools, going down 5–0. Craig Short coming towards the end of his career, opened the scoring for Rovers and it was his cross that enabled them to double the advantage when Steve Davis turned the ball into his own net. Two second-half goals from Matt Jansen and a late Craig Hignett strike completed the scoring in the last league game between the clubs until 2009.
Following Burnley's Play-off success in 2009 they were promoted to the Premiership for the first time in their history. This meant that the two teams would meet in the top division of English football for the first time since January 1966. The match was built up in the press.
For the trip to Ewood Park, Burnley fans could only purchase match day tickets if they also bought coach ticket; they were forced to travel on designated buses which set off at 9am on the morning of the game for the 1 o'clock kickoff for only a 15-mile journey. The same arrangements were made for Rovers fans on their way to turf moor with fans being forced to travel on designated buses.
Robbie Blake gave Burnley an early lead but goals from David Dunn, Franco Di Santo and Pascal Chimbonda gave them a 3–1 half time lead. Chris Eagles got a very late consolation for Burnley but the bragging rights remain at Ewood. A large police presence including mounted officers, dog units and riot officers made a total of 30 arrests on the scene as violence erupted inside and outside the pub, adding up to the total figure of 55 arrests in the day, sealing the premises off in a bid to prevent the planned violence further erupting. Police described the violence as one of the worst cases of violence they had ever seen. After the game, football intelligence officers noticed fans moving in ones and twos away from the town centre, towards the Cherry Tree pub. As police resources were directed to the Station Hotel they allegedly came under attack from bottles and cans thrown from the beer garden. Some fans were told to leave the area and others were arrested at the time.
Blackburn completed a double over their rivals when the two sides meet again in April 2010. David Dunn scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot after Martin Olsson was judged to have been fouled, despite minimal contact with the Burnley player.
In the buildup to the match at Turf Moor, Blackburn player David Dunn said in the local newspaper that he hopes "Rovers thump Burnley 10–0", by then going on to say "I hope they stay up" this implying that he would like to keep the derby alive. After the game 150 seats in the away end were ripped up and the sinks in the toilets smashed with 42 arrests made involving both Rovers and Clarets fans, in and around the ground. Police were forced to use batons as fans from both sides tried to get at each other, this was not helped as rovers fans were allowed to drink in the stands due to a crush in the concourse causing bottles to be thrown at Burnley fans and vice versa, an episode that has become too familiar with this fixture in recent times.
Blackburn Rovers 0–1 win over Burnley continues a 31-year run of Rovers dominance in the area. Burnley were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season putting the East Lancashire Derby on hold until Blackburn's relegation to the Championship at the end of the 2011-12 season.
As Blackburn Rovers were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2011-12 season, the East Lancashire derby took place in the Football League Championship for the first time since the name change (from First Division). The first fixture took place at Turf Moor on 2nd December 2012. Unlike previous fixtures, the match received relatively low coverage by the media, although there was a large police presence at the game. Jordan Rhodes converted a Mauro Formica cross to give Rovers the lead 68 minutes in, a lead which was cancelled out by a late Sam Vokes header to salvage a point for the Clarets. It was Rovers however who salvaged a point in the reverse fixture on March 17th 2013, with David Dunn's 95th-minute equaliser cancelling out Jason Shackell's first half strike extending the Clarets' long wait for a victory over their rivals. Dunn's goal was the subject of much controversy in the aftermath of the match as replays showed he was clearly standing in an offside position. Although it was a number of yards offside, it was understandable how the referees assistant failed to give the decision. When the initial ball was played, Dunn was stood onside. However, as the ball traveled towards the Burnley box, Rovers midfielder Jason Lowe got a slight touche on the ball, flicking it on to Dunn, who had since moved into an offside position. Therefore, Dunn had received the ball in an offside position and the goal should have been disallowed. The referees assistant did not see Lowe's touch and therefore allowed the goal to stand.
Burnley had made the better start to the 2013-2014 season, finding themselves in a play-off place as the opening derby of the season approached, with Rovers lying in mid-table. The game was played on 14th September 2013 and, like previous fixtures, was a fiercely contested affair. Junior Stanislas crashed in what would go on to be voted the fans goal of the season on 76 minutes. Following a slick interchange with inform striker, Danny Ings, Stanislas crashed home a left footed shot from 25 yards, leaving the Burnley fans sensing a long awaited victory. However, the lead lasted only 9 minutes as Rovers equalised in somewhat fortuitous fashion. A poor back-pass by Burnley's Scott Arfield was pounced upon by Jordan Rhodes off whom the ball deflected over goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, following an attempted clearance by Michael Duff. The game finished 1-1 and Rovers retaining the bragging rights with Burnley failing to record a victory in this fixture for over 35 years.
The last fixture between the sides came on Sunday 9th March 2014 at Ewood Park. Burnley were the form team going into the clash, sitting 2nd in the league, eight points ahead of 3rd placed Derby County. Rovers lay 10th, six points outside the play-offs. As expected, it was another tight affair, with the sides playing out a cagey first 20 minutes. Jordan Rhodes scored his third goal in this fixture on 24 minutes to give Rovers the lead. Rovers stayed in front until 73rd minute when Burnley equalised through captain Jason Shackell, who headed in a Ross Wallace free-kick. The visitors, buoyed by their equaliser, pushed for a long-awaited winner. It finally came as Wallace's initial effort was blocked by Adam Henley before Danny Ings got there ahead of team-mate Ashley Barnes to find the net with his 25th goal of the season. The final whistle sparked raucous scenes among the Burnley fans at Ewood Park, who had celebrated ending their 35-year wait for a victory in this fixture.
Burnley's promotion to the Premier League for 2014-15 paused the fixture, although subsequent relegation at the end of the 2014-15 season meant the East Lancashire derby resumed with 2 fixtures between the sides during the Football League Championship 2015-2016 season, both won by Burnley who are now unbeaten for six seasons in the tie.
"As of 5 March 2016"
Blackburn won their first honour in 1884 with victory in the FA Cup. Burnley's first honour came in 1914 by winning the FA Cup. Burnley are the smallest town to give birth to a professional FA Cup winning and finalist team.
Overall honours:
Honours after WOI:
<br>
Jack Bruton is the only man to score for both sides against the other. At Burnley, he managed to land 44 goals himself in 176 matches before Rovers broke their transfer record by paying £6,500 in December 1929. He did not take long repaying it, making 344 appearances for Blackburn, scoring 115 goals and also ending up managing the club for a short period after the war. His loss to the Turf Moor side could be glimpsed by the fact that they were relegated that season yet were in mid-table when he departed to Ewood. Bruton played 250 games in total for both clubs.
Keith Newton, a left-back and a product of Rovers FA Youth Cup winning side of 1959 played 357 times for Blackburn before joining Everton in time to win a Championship medal in 1970. However, Burnley pounced in 1972 to obtain his services and it proved a very successful move into the transfer market as he was an ever-present in his first season which saw Burnley promoted to Division One. In all, he turned out in either a Rovers or Burnley shirt on a record number of 593 occasions in the league and cup.
Another fullback to make the move from Turf Moor to Ewood via another club, Leeds this time, was Kevin Hird. Converted to a midfielder at Burnley, Hird – a lifelong Clarets supporter – was forgiven the Boxing Day goal he scored for Rovers against Burnley in 1978. He found the net 29 times at Burnley from midfield and appeared in 94 games for them to add to his 145 matches for Rovers.
Three Burnley stalwarts of the 1950s and 60s, who all eventually found themselves down the road at Blackburn, were goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw, defender Walter Joyce and winger John Connelly. Blacklaw, a Scottish international, played 110 games for Rovers. Previously he had been a popular figure at Turf Moor where his figure of 374 league and cup games was bettered only by Alan Stevenson and Jerry Dawson, as far as goalkeepers were concerned. Connelly was bought by Rovers in 1966 when he joined them from Manchester United after obtaining another Championship winners medal to go with the one he secured at Turf Moor in 1960. In those earlier times he had often been the thorn in Rovers’ side, scoring five times against them in League and Cup in his total of 103 in 260 games for Burnley. His Rovers record was 39 goals in 163 matches. At his peak he played 20 times for England and was a member of Englands World Cup squad in 1966.
In recent years a couple of Blackburn players have had loan spells at Burnley, these being Jay McEveley and Andy Todd. Ex Blackburn player Alan Mahon joined Burnley in 2006 although he had a spell at Wigan in between. Mahon's Blackburn debut came as an 89th Minute substitute in the Derby match at Turf Moor on 17 December 2000. David May who played for Blackburn between 1988 and 1994, captained Burnley in his one season there in the 2003–04 season. Whilst Andy Cole who signed for Blackburn for a club record £8 million in 2001 spent six months on loan from Sunderland at Turf Moor towards the end of his career in 2008.
As far as appearances in local derbies go, the honours are shared between two highly respected players from each side.
The Burnley player with the most appearances is goalkeeper Jerry Dawson, who played between the Clarets sticks until past the age of 40, finally bowing out on Christmas Day 1928 at Turf Moor. Between 1913 and 1926 he faced the Rovers forwards on 19 occasions (18 league and one FA Cup).
The leading Blackburn player on the same score is Ronnie Clayton who amassed his total during the 1950s and 1960s playing 15 times in the League and four in the FA Cup.
The FA Cup figure is a record held between the clubs that he shares with his old adversary, Jimmy Adamson of Burnley.
Behind Dawson and Clayton comes Bryan Douglas with 17 (14 League and 3 FA Cup) and he is followed home by Burnley's Brian Miller with 16 (13 + 3).
In the 1990–91 season Burnley lost in the Division 4 play offs to Torquay consigning them to another season in the lowest league in English football. After the match a plane flew over Turf Moor with a banner saying "Staying down forever luv Rovers Ha Ha Ha". This prank has largely been attributed to former Blackburn striker Simon Garner although he denies this, but does claim to know who was responsible.
Burnley fans gained some revenge after Blackburn Rovers were beaten by the semi-pro Swedish team Trelleborgs FF in the UEFA Cup 1994, where Burnley fans changed a road sign to 'twin' Burnley with Trelleborg.
Prior to the meeting in the Premier League in the 2009-10 season, Burnley fans snuck into Ewood Park and dressed up the statue of former Blackburn owner Jack Walker in a Burnley kit. This led to retaliation by Blackburn fans a few days later when they scrawled graffiti and dressed a cone with a Blackburn shirt. Also, the Blackburn fans hung banners over motorway bridges, one reading "Your Mum’s Your Dad, Inbred Bastards", when Burnley fans were coached to Ewood.
Also at the match at Burnley 09-10 season Blackburn Rovers fans decided to wear Owen Coyle masks to wind the Burnley fans up as they called him the 'messiah' then change to 'judas' when he left to go Bolton.
In the lead up to the corresponding fixture in March 2010, police allegedly foiled a plot by Burnley fans to paint Blackburn midfielder David Dunn's house Claret & Blue. On 7 May 2012 during Blackburn vs Wigan at Ewood Park, Burnley supporters arranged a plane to fly over Ewood Park which read - In Venky's we trust-Burnley SU. Blackburn lost this fixture 1-0 and were subsequently relegated from the Premier League.

Shirt stud

A shirt stud is a decorative fastener that fits onto a buttonhole on the front of a pleated shirt, or onto the starched bib of a stiff-front shirt. Such shirts have special buttonholes solely for shirt studs.
A shirt stud may be fashioned from alloys, precious metals, and gemstones—materials uncommon to buttons sewn on shirts. The stud may have an inlay, such as of pearl or onyx.
Dress code of the modern western world reserves shirt studs for men's formal wear and some semi-formal occasions.
In the western world, shirt studs were first used in the mid-19th century, when some shirt fronts were too stiff to close with buttons. So remains the case for the heavily starched, modern full dress shirts worn with white tie.

Save the Last Dance 2

Save the Last Dance 2 (also known as "Save the Last Dance 2: Stepping Up") is a direct-to-video sequel to 2001's theatrical feature "Save the Last Dance". It was released to DVD on October 10, 2006 by Paramount Home Entertainment and MTV. While featuring some returning characters, none of the original cast (including Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas) are retained from the original film. R&B singer Ne-Yo makes an appearance in the film.
The film continues the story of Sara Johnson (originally played by Julia Stiles and now portrayed by Izabella Miko). She recalls how she was born to be a dancer. Her mother would often comment that she knew how to pirouette before she could properly walk. From her earliest memories Sara always wanted to be a ballerina, a graceful dancer who could glide across the stage. It seemed that there was something that caused conflict in Sara’s ambition. She also loves the urban dance form of hip-hop. While ballet is highly structured, full of rules and standards, hip-hop gives Sara a chance to let go and follow the beat. Sara wants the best of both worlds but the conflict between structure and independence affects her performance in both genres.
The film is set soon after the original. Sara has made the first part of her dream come true. Her audition with the Juilliard School of Dance worked out well and she was accepted, resulting in her moving from Chicago to New York City. Sara would soon find out that as rough as it was to get there, staying would require raising the bar to almost painful heights. Her main dance teacher, Monique Delacroix (Jacqueline Bisset), is old school when it comes to demanding each student master the traditional and arduous curriculum. She has little to no use for the influence of any other form of dance on ballet, so the concept of hip-hop is not only foreign to the staid teacher, it is repugnant.
During orientation on her first day at Juilliard, Sara meets Miles Sultana (Columbus Short), who takes her for a trombone player. When she tells him she is there for ballet, he questions whether she is a ballerina. Sara boldly states that she is already a ballerina; she is there to become a prima ballerina. This sets up a playful antagonism that ends up in a romantic relationship. Sara also has to deal with the students at her new school. In a high pressure school like Juilliard, the more favor you gather with the teachers the more jealousy you encounter from the students. It is a cut-throat environment with an extremely high failure rate. Among her new classmates is Marcus (Matthew Watling), who infuriates Ms Delacroix the first day for wearing pants that 'swish'. Then there is Katrina (Maria Brooks), who is destined to be the main rival for Sara. It also turns out that Miles is actually her professor for 'Introduction to Hip-Hop Theory'. Miles invites Sara and her friend Zowi to a club, where Sara shows her skills by dancing with a girl. Due to her activities in the club she is late for her ballet class and is scolded and punished by Ms Delacroix. Despite that, Sara tries to impress Ms Delacroix by taking ballet very serious, which makes her decline Miles' request for her to lead them in choreography. However, she later agrees after Ms Delacroix tells her that she is not going to drop her.
Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com was critical of the film, complaining it "retreads the original Dance pretty much completely". He notes that Miko lacks the girl-next-door charm of Stiles, but suggests she does make for a more credible ballerina.
The film was released on DVD October 10, 2006. The DVD includes a making of feature.

BA-X

BA-X is a labour market index published since January 2007 by the German Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit [BA]).
The BA-X is a labour market index published monthly by the Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA). The index tracks the demand for manpower in the primary labor market.
The BA-X is based on concrete openings for jobs at business establishments and not on surveys or assessments. Information on all non-promoted jobs that are known to the BA are included in the index. In addition to the non-promoted jobs that are reported to the BA, there are jobs for freelancers and the self-employed; jobs reported by private recruitment agencies; and additional jobs from the BA Job Exchange as well as from the BA Job Robot. The BA has knowledge of far more than half of the total job opportunities on the primary labour market in Germany. Hence, the BA has a very broad foundation and provides a representative snapshot of the German job market.
All components for the calculation of the jobs known to the BA have only been available in full since 2004. The BA-X therefore begins with 2004 as the baseline year at an index level of 100. The BA-X is seasonally adjusted, and consequently, typical seasonal fluctuations are suppressed. The BA-X is an early indicator of the economic situation and a measurement of the actual employment climate in German business establishments. The BA-X is released monthly on the day before the monthly press conference.

Western River Railroad

The Western River Railroad is Tokyo Disneyland's version of its steam-powered railroad. It does not circle the whole park; it instead passes through Adventureland, Westernland and Critter Country. Additionally, this railroad differs from other Disney railroads because its track gauge is narrow gauge as compared with other Disney railroad track gauges of narrow gauge. At the time that the Western River Railroad was opened, Japanese rail regulations required that any railway line with more than one stop be subject to the same rules as any other conventional rail line. As such, there is only one stop on the Western River Railroad in order to avoid having to charge fares and to allow the use of passenger cars that are not fully enclosed, which would not be allowed otherwise. Guests pass the Jungle Cruise, the Big Thunder Mountain, an old "mining town" featuring an ex Rio Grande Southern caboose, the Rivers of America, Splash Mountain, and passes through a version of the Primeval World before heading back to the station. It is presented by Takara Tomy.
The Western River Railroad has four narrow gauge 2-4-0 steam locomotives named after famous rivers located primarily in the Western United States (hence the name):

Battle of Korakesion

The Battle of Korakesion, also known as the Battle of Coracesium, was a naval battle fought in 67 BC between the pirates of Cilicia and Pompey of ancient Rome. Plutarch describes it as the key battle of Pompey's clearing of the Mediterranean of pirates after several smaller battles. He writes of the battle that the pirates had about one thousand ships (almost certainly an exaggeration) against Pompey's two hundred, but were defeated in the initial naval engagement.
After retreating to the shore, the pirates were apparently besieged in the town of Coracesium, modern day Alanya, before surrendering.

Crib barn

Crib barns were a popular type of barn found throughout the U.S. south and southeast regions. Crib barns were especially ubiquitous in the Appalachian and Ozark Mountain states of North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri and Arkansas.
These barns were composed of multiple cribs, up to six, which were used for feed storage or livestock pens. Crib barn construction was somewhat simplistic compared to other types of barns, such as the prairie barn or the round barn, which gained popularity in American agriculture. Crib barns were most often built of unchinked logs and may or may not have included a hay loft depending on the specific barn. Unaltered examples of crib barns usually have roofs covered with undressed wood shingles, which, over time, were replaced with tin or asphalt. It is the rustic appearance of crib barns that cause them to stand out.
The most popular type of crib barn built in the Appalachian states was also the simplest to construct considering its size and stability. The "Double Crib" consisted of two cribs separated by a breezeway and covered by the same roof. This type of barn is the most common in Appalachia. The doors in this type of crib barn face either front or in, toward the breezeway. The loft, as is typical with crib barns that have lofts, is used for storage of feed and hay in this design of crib barn while the first floor is used for stabling. The breezeway, which essentially acted as a driveway which entered the barn was often used for threshing grain.

Ebro Treaty

The Ebro Treaty was a treaty signed in 226 BC by Hasdrubal the Fair of Carthage and the Roman Republic, which fixed the river Ebro in Iberia as the boundary between the two powers of Rome and Carthage. Under the terms of the treaty, Carthage would not expand north of the Ebro, as long as Rome likewise did not expand to the south of the river.
The exact date is unknown, but some time after 226 BC, Rome became affiliated with the town of Saguntum south of the Ebro River. Polybius tells us that the Carthaginian general Hannibal had been looking for a pretext for war. After briefly consulting with the Carthaginian senate, Hannibal proceeded to besiege Saguntum which resulted in an eight-month siege. The Roman senate upon hearing of the siege immediately sent embassies to consult with Hannibal and then with the Carthaginian senate. Initially the Roman embassies demanded that Carthage hand over Hannibal for attacking a Roman ally, which the Carthaginians refused. The Carthaginian senate stated that it was the Saguntines that began the war, and that the Romans had no grounds on which to accuse the Carthaginians.
The Romans were unable to come to the aid of Saguntum before the town fell in 219 BC. After Saguntum fell the Romans made preparations for war and sent a second embassy to Carthage. The Roman envoys demanded that Carthage hand over Hannibal and any others responsible for the attack on Saguntum. Livy states that this second embassy was sent simply to follow the formalities of officially declaring war; meaning that the Romans fully anticipated a renewed war with Carthage. Both Livy and Polybius discuss the argument between the second Roman embassy and the Carthaginian senate before the declaration of war was made.
It was at this point that the Carthaginian senate refused to acknowledge the Ebro treaty and also refused to hand over Hannibal to the Romans. The Carthaginians are said to have compared this treaty to the one made between Catulus and Hamilcar Barca in 241 BC. Here the Carthaginians argued that the Roman people refused to accept the treaty made between the two generals because it had not been ratified by the people. The Roman envoys refused to accept this argument, and unable to come to an agreement war was declared in 218 BC. The ensuing conflict is now known as the Second Punic War, which lasted until 201 BC.

<doc id="9364926" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9364926" title="Roman d'Enéas">
Roman d'Enéas

Le Roman d'Enéas is a "romance" of Medieval French literature, dating to ca. 1160. It is written in French octosyllabic couplets totaling a little over 10,000 lines. Its subject matter is the tale of Aeneas, based on Virgil's "Aeneid". It is one of the three important "Romans d'Antiquité" ("Romances of Antiquity") of this period; the other two are the "Roman de Thèbes" (anonymous) and the "Roman de Troie" of Benoît de Sainte-Maure.
Virgil's poem emphasizes the hero's political role as founder of Rome, marked by the famous break in his wanderings when he hopes that he can settle down with the Queen of Carthage, Dido; instead, he must continue to Italy and marry the king's daughter (a character on whom Virgil wastes no interest or sentiment) in order to found a great lineage. The French author, writing "an idiosyncratic adaptation of Virgil's classic", is particularly interested in the hero's romantic relationships, both with Dido and with the princess Lavine, who becomes the central character of the later part of the romance. Lavine and Enéas fall in love at first sight, and it is important to her to know that this love transcends his merely lustful relationship with Dido (and possible feelings for other men, too, since in this version of the Aeneas legend he is alleged to be "a lover of boys", and thus "Queen Amata vociferously opposes her daughter Lavinia's proposed marriage with Aeneas"). For Enéas, this true love provides the strength and motive he needs to win the war against Lavine's former fiancé, Turnus. The vivid woman characters of this romance discuss with each other and with themselves the meaning of love in a light but touching way that was new in vernacular literature, and modeled on Ovid rather than on Virgil. At about this time—or a little later—other authors, such as Chrétien de Troyes and Thomas of Britain, were also learning to pause their narratives to allow their characters to consider the nature and power of love.
While the narrative mostly follow's Virgil, there are differences. A minor one, for instance, concerns Turnus and Enéas: in Virgil, Aeneas kills Turnus, at the end of the epic, because he recognizes the swordbelt that Turnus took from Pallas. In the "Roman", it is a ring that Enéas recognizes, a motif that Michelle Freeman sees repeated in Marie de France's "Le Fresne".
The "Roman d'Enéas" is the basis for the Limburgish romance "Eneas" by Heinrich von Veldeke. Elements and motifs from the "Roman" are found throughout Marie de France's lais, including "Le Fresne" and "Guigemar". In the latter, the lengthy prologue to the love affair mirrors the courtship of Enéas and Lavinia, and the magic ship and the castle also recall the "Roman", according to Ernst Hoepffner.

Bertha Phillpotts

Dame Bertha Surtees Phillpotts (1877–1932) was an English scholar in Scandinavian languages, literature, history, archaeology and anthropology.
Bertha Phillpotts was born in Bedford on 25 October 1877. Her father, James Surtees Phillpotts (1839-1930), was headmaster of Bedford School and instrumental in turning it from a relatively obscure grammar school to a top-ranking public school. Her mother, Marian Hadfield Phillpotts née Cordery (1843-1925), was a competent linguist. Bertha was educated at home before going to the University of Cambridge. She studied medieval and modern languages, Old Norse and Celtic at Girton College between 1898 and 1902, and then travelled to Iceland and Copenhagen as a research student. She worked as a librarian at Girton College from 1906 to 1909, and in 1913 she became the first Lady Carlisle Research Fellow at Somerville College, Oxford.
During the First World War she worked for some time at the British Legation in Stockholm, on a largely voluntary basis. Her elder brother Owen Surtees Phillpotts was Commercial Attaché at the legation. Bertha Phillpotts' services were requested by the head of mission Sir Esmé Howard, and she undertook both clerical and research work for him.
Bertha Phillpotts was Principal of Westfield College from 1919 until 1921, and a member of the College Council from 1922 until 1932. She became the Mistress of Girton College in 1922, succeeding Katharine Jex-Blake (1860-1951) who happened to be her first cousin (the daughter of her mother's sister Henrietta Cordery and Thomas Jex-Blake, sometime Headmaster of Rugby School). She held this post until 1925 when, following the death of her mother, she resigned in order to look after her elderly father who was living in retirement in Tunbridge Wells. However she was elected to a research fellowship and continued to be an active Fellow of the college, commuting between Tunbridge Wells and Cambridge in her own car.
From 1926 until her death in 1932 she was director of Scandinavian studies and university lecturer at Girton College. Her research included translations of old Icelandic sagas and studies on the influence of Old Norse and Icelandic on the English language. She is particularly known for her theory of ritual drama as the background to the Eddic poems.
In recognition of her wartime service at the British Legation in Stockholm, Bertha Phillpotts was honoured in the Order of the British Empire list for 1918.
In 1929 she was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her services to education.
In 1931 she married an astrophysicist and educator, Hugh Frank Newall, FRS. Bertha Phillpotts is buried (as Bertha Surtees Newall) next to her parents in Tunbridge Wells Cemetery, while Hugh Frank Newall is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.
The Dame Bertha Phillpotts Memorial Fund for the promotion of Old Norse and Icelandic Studies at the University of Cambridge awards grants and scholarships for postgraduate students and other scholars in the relevant fields.
Bertha Phillpotts possessed a lively personality and an intrepid spirit, as the following tributes show.
"Is there another woman head of a College, who not only is a yachting expert, but has had distinguished professors for her disciples in the art of sailing? On her first visit to Iceland a pony was the sole companion of her wanderings; and we know not which to admire most – her rapid assimilation of University affairs, when called to serve on the Statutory Commission, or her intrepidity in driving a motor, as to the manner born, through Bridge and Sidney Streets, as a novice with but four or five lessons behind her.
" (Cambridge Review)
"Summer before last she came to stay with us at Blakeney [Norfolk], having motored in ‘Freda’ from Cambridge. She was already not well, and came for a rest. But hearing our son was racing his boat that afternoon she insisted on going in the Parthenia along with him ... The Parthenia came in a long way first, and won the cup. Dame Bertha then leapt into another boat and came in second. The next day she was in another boat and was placed third. I then thought it time to reprove her for racing three times in two days – and she not well. But her only reply was, "Don’t! When you talk to me like that the buttons burst off my shoes!" ... In appearance she was girlish, with a lovely head and a beautiful profile and hair. Her keen eyes and quick, almost bird-like movements but added to her charm. She was one who, for all her learning, her high sense of duty, had a gallant gaiety altogether her own." (Mary Anderson, Madame de Navarro)

Ultraa

Ultraa is a DC Comics character, originally the first superhuman on Earth Prime. The original first appeared in "Justice League of America" #153 (April 1978), he was created by Gerry Conway and George Tuska. The current Ultraa first appeared in "Justice League Quarterly" #13 (Winter 1993), written by Kevin Dooley and drawn by Greg LaRocque. A new version of Ultraa appears in Grant Morrison's The Multiversity project.
Ultraa's origin was very similar to Superman's, in that he was born on an alien world, and sent to Earth to escape its destruction. He landed in the Australian Outback and was raised by Indigenous Australians. In his first appearance, Ultraa plans to go to the United States of America and become a superhero. As he runs across the ocean, he is detected by the US Air Force, which sends a plane after him. Ultraa retaliates to this attack, and is mistaken for a villain by the Justice League, who are visiting from Earth One. Ultraa eventually decides Earth Prime was not ready for superheroes and accompanies the League back to their world.
Ultraa next appeared following a battle between the League and the Injustice Gang which threatened civilians, he decides Earth One was also endangered by the presence of superhumans. He uses a ray gun to create a feeling of apathy in both the League and the Injustice Gang. Unfortunately, it works on the heroes but has the opposite effect on the villains. Ultraa attempts to fight the Injustice Gang single handedly but fails. After the JLA overcome the ray's effects to defeat the Gang, they question whether they can trust Ultraa any longer.
As a result of their second encounter with Ultraa, the League imprisons him in a "stasis cube" prison of Superman's design. He is later released by an alien hive mind entity disguised as a human attorney. The alien entity helps Ultraa take the Justice League members who imprisoned him to court for wrongful imprisonment, but it is later learned that the trial is meant as a distraction to keep the JLA from noticing that the bulk of the hive mind entity, known as the Over-Complex, was stealing the hydrogen atoms from the world's oceans.
After this, a dispirited Ultraa adopts the civilian guise of Jack Grey and lives a simple life as a busboy in Atlantic City where he is manipulated by a down and out former opponent of the Justice League, but a heart to heart talk with Hawkman convinces him to break off the attack and Ultraa subsequently decides to live out his life among Earth-1's Australian aborigines. This is his last pre-"Crisis" appearance.
Following the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the original Ultraa was retconned out of history, along with Earth-Prime. In "Justice League Quarterly" #13 (Winter 1993), Ultraa is reintroduced as a native of Almerac and the betrothed of Queen Maxima. He arrives on Earth to look for her, and gets into a long and brutal fight with Captain Atom. Captain Atom briefly gains the upper hand and nearly kills Ultraa, however he realizes that he himself is behaving as brutally as Ultraa and decides to throw the fight in order not to set a poor example (that might is right) for an onlooking boy. Ultraa in turn starts beating up Captain Atom, but Maxima intervenes and tells him to leave. Maxima then tells Captain Atom he can stop pretending he is unconscious and the two walk off together.
Ultraa later appears as a member of the United Nations funded League Busters in "Justice League International" v2, #65 (Jun 1994).
In Grant Morrison's Multiversity series, the eighth installment, "The Multiversity: Ultra Comics #1" features a new version of the character, named "Ultra Comics." He comes from Earth-Prime, now also designated Earth-33. He is described as a self-aware idea, a hero created by the "Memesmiths" of Earth-Prime to defend us from the Gentry. As flesh-and-blood superhumans don't exist here on Earth-Prime, Ultra only exists in the form of a "cybernetic comic book" That is, the comic books themselves are his "body," and he gets his powers from the minds of his readers, suggesting that we are empowering, and essentially becoming, him whenever we read his comic. Within the story, he is depicted as a superhero created in a laboratory and sent out into battle against the Gentry, eventually facing off against the Post-Crisis version of Ultraa.

Central Registry of State Judicial Administrations

The Central Registry of State Judicial Administrations (, "ZESt") in Salzgitter, West Germany was established on 24 November 1961 in the aftermath of the construction of the Berlin Wall. Its function was to verify human rights violations by the government of East Germany like homicide at the Inner German border, political persecution, torture and maltreatment, etc. Intended for deterrence, in the long run the information should have led to the initiation of criminal proceedings in the case of a reunification. The organization was financed by all western German States. It was dissolved in 1992 after the German reunification.
The implementation of the Central Registry of State Judicial Administrations on 24 November 1961 was induced by the West Berlin mayor Willy Brandt in order to improve the nationwide coordination of the states' law enforcement agencies. The prosecutors working at the ZESt in Salzgitter-Bad were affiliated with the district attorney's office at Braunschweig. They initiated preliminary investigations, collected evidences and recorded testimonies. The ZESt also produced criminal reports on East German applicants for the West German civil service.
The East German government regarded the institution as an element of revanchism and interference in its domestic affairs. In the course of Brandt's "Ostpolitik", the legitimation was increasingly challenged. General Secretary Erich Honecker explicitly demanded its dissolution, but also the Bundestag parliamentary group of the Social Democratic Party in a 1984 resolution unanimously denoted the ZESt "ineffective" and "needless". In 1987, the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia under Minister-President Johannes Rau annulled its benefits. Shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the agency was about to fold.
After reunification, the ZESt provided its files on about 40,000 proceedings for the local law enforcement agencies in the new states of Germany, and was dissolved in 1992. Since 2007, the entire collection is preserved at the German Federal Archives in Koblenz.

Inter-District Championship

The Inter-District Championship (IDC) is the most important event in the Fiji Football Association calendar. Teams representing various football playing districts of Fiji have taken part in this annual event every year, except 1987 due to disruptions caused by military coups, since the formation of the Association in 1938. Teams compete for the coveted Lloyd Farebrother Trophy, donated by the first President of the Fiji Football Association, A.S. Farebrother and Lloyd and Company.
Only five teams (Suva, Rewa, Ba, Levuka and Lautoka), took part in the first IDC held in Suva in 1938. From 1938 to 1975, the competition was initially held on a knock out format but in 1976 pool play was introduced. From 1985, the competition was held in two divisions with the introduction of a second level tournament known as the Premier Division. In 1999 there was a short lived third level division.
With Navua registering its first ever win of the IDC tournament in 2009, all the current (as of January 2010) Super Premium Division teams have now won the Lloyd Farebrother Trophy one or more time(s).
Lautoka holds the record for highest scores in the Idc finals thrashing Ba twice, 6 -0 and 7- 0 and also beat Suva in one of the finals 7 - 1.
The tournament is divided into two divisions. The Premier division (previously 10 teams) is currently made up of 8 district teams. At present these teams are Ba, Labasa, Lautoka, Nadi, Nadroga, Rewa, Suva, and Tailevu/Naitasiri. The teams are divided into two pools of four and each team plays all the other teams once, usually over four days. A win is worth 3 points, a draw 1 point and a loss 0 points. The top two teams in each pool qualify for the semi-finals, with the winner of each pool playing the runner-up of the other pool. The semi-finals and the final are played on the same day.
The First division is made up of 14 teams. At present these teams are Bua, Dreketi, Lami, Nadogo, Nalawa, Nasinu, Navua, Rakiraki, Seaqaqa, Savusavu, Tavua, Tailevu North, Taveuni and Vatukoula. The teams are divided into three pools of four and each team plays all the other teams once, over four days. A win is worth 3 points, a draw 1 point and a loss 0 points. The top team in each pool plus the best runner-up qualify for the semi-finals. The semi-finals and the final are played on the same day.

Crabtree effect

"See also": Evolution of aerobic fermentation
Named after the English biochemist Herbert Grace Crabtree, the Crabtree effect describes the phenomenon whereby the yeast, "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", produces ethanol (alcohol) in aerobic conditions and high external glucose concentrations rather than producing biomass via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the usual process occurring aerobically in most yeasts e.g. "Kluyveromyces spp""." This phenomenon is observed in most species of the "Saccharomyces", "Schizosaccharomyces, Debaryomyces, Brettanomyces, Torulopsis, Nematospora, and Nadsonia" genera. Increasing concentrations of glucose accelerates glycolysis (the breakdown of glucose) which results in the production of appreciable amounts of ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation. This reduces the need of oxidative phosphorylation done by the TCA cycle via the electron transport chain and therefore decreases oxygen consumption. The phenomenon is believed to have evolved as a competition mechanism (due to the antiseptic nature of ethanol) around the time when the first fruits on Earth fell from the trees. The crabtree effect works by repressing respiration by the fermentation pathway, dependent on the substrate.

Newport by-election, 1945

The Newport by-election, 1945 was a parliamentary by-election held on 17 May 1945 for the British House of Commons constituency of Newport in Monmouthshire. It was the last by-election of the 1935-1945 Parliament.
The seat had become vacant on the death of the constituency's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Sir Reginald Clarry, on 17 January 1945, aged 62. He had held the seat since a 1922 by-election, with a two-year gap after his defeat at the 1929 general election (he was re-elected at the 1931 election).
The Conservative Party selected as its candidate Ronald Bell, an Oxford-educated barrister who had been heavily defeated at the Caerphilly by-election in 1939. In keeping with a war-time electoral pact, the Labour and Liberal parties did not field candidates, and Bell's only opponent was Robert Edwards, the Chairman of the Independent Labour Party (ILP).
On a considerably reduced turnout, Bell held the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of 2,702 votes; Edwards had won 45.5% of the votes, one of the ILP's best results for years.
However, Bell's tenure as MP for Newport was brief. The date of the general election was announced on 23 May, and Parliament was dissolved on 15 June. In the Labour Party's landslide victory at general election on 5 July 1945, Bell was heavily defeated by the Labour Party candidate, Peter Freeman.
He returned to the House of Commons at the 1950 general election as MP for South Buckinghamshire.

Storkyrkobrinken

Storkyrkobrinken (Swedish: "Big Church Slope") is a street in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden.
Leading from Högvaktsterrassen ("Main Guard Terrace") near the Royal Palace down to Myntgatan ("Coin Street") and Riddarhustorget ("Knight's House Square") it forms a parallel street to Salviigränd and Stora Gråmunkegränd and is crossed by Trångsund, Prästgatan, and Västerlånggatan.
The street's present name stems from the vicinity to the cathedral Storkyrkan.
Since the Middle Ages, the street and various sections of it appears under different names referring to various activities and prominent buildings.
In medieval times, Storkyrkobrinken was the main slope leading up to the village church on the top of Stadsholmen. The crossing street Västerlånggatan was the street passing outside the city wall on the city's western side, and there was a city gate which permitted Storkyrkobrinken to enter the city. In 1422 Storkyrkobrinken is referred to as "sancte nicolauese port" ("Gate of Saint Nicholas") while the section outside the city wall (west of Västerlånggatan) appears as "S:t Laurentii gränd" ("Alley of Saint Lawrence") in 1436 and a name it retained throughout the second half of that century. St Nicholas of Myra (-350), patron saint of merchants and seamen, had a statue in the street to which people would offer before shipping expeditions, and a chaplain in the 1670s explains both the church, the street, and city were named after the saint until the 1570s, notwithstanding the statue was destroyed earlier that century.
A century later it was named after the school ("skolstuga" literally translates into "School cottage") built in the street in 1431. In 1520 it is thus called "Scolestue backen" ("School Cottage Slope") and in 1571 the section west of Västerlånggatan is named "skolstuffue grenden" ("School Cottage Alley"). During the 16th century it appears as "Kyrkobrinken" ("Church Slope") in 1596 and as "S. Niclaes Brinck" ("St Nicholas Slope") in 1597.
During the so-called era of the Swedish Empire, attempts were made to rename various structures in the present old town to give them names more to the taste of the ambitions of the era. Storkyrkobrinken thus appears as "Slottsgatan" ("Palace Street") in 1637 (it also connects the Royal Palace to the western waterfront), while other names, such as "Riddargatan" ("Knight's Street") and "Riddarhusgatan" ("Knight's House Street"), were used during the 17th century to associate the street with the prestigious Riddarhuset.
In 1650, however, it appears as "Store kyrke brincken" ("Big Church Slope") and the following year even as "Svenska Kyrkobrinken" ("Swedish Church Slope") in order to distinguish it from Tyska Brinken ("German Slope") which still leads up to the German Church.
Lastly it appears as "Scholstugu gr"["änd"] ("School Cottage Alley") in 1733, before being named "Storkyrko Brinken" ("Big Church Slope") in 1771.

English barn

The English barn, or three bay barn, is a barn style that was most popular in the northeast region of the USA, but are the most widespread barn type in America. This barn type is, with the New World Dutch barn the oldest type and has been called the "...grandfather of the American barn." New barns in this style were constructed for over a century, from the 1770s through the 1900s.
The early pioneers brought with them a barn design inherited from the first colonists. An average English barn measured thirty feet by forty feet and had a large double wagon door on its lateral side and unpainted vertical boards covering the walls. English barns were normally without a basement and stood on level ground. The interior of the barns were characterized by a center driveway which acted as a threshing floor, similar to the breezeway of a crib barn. The double doors generally opened onto the center drive which divided the building into two separate areas, one for hay and grain storage and the other for livestock.

Manqué

Manqué (feminine, "manquée") is a term used in reference to a person who has failed to live up to a specific expectation or ambition. It is usually used in combination with a profession: for example, a career civil servant with political prowess who nonetheless never attained political office might be described as a "politician manqué". It can also be used relative to a specific role model; a second-rate method actor might be referred to as a "Marlon Brando manqué".
The term derives from the past participle of the French verb "manquer" (to miss, to fail, to lack). In English, it is used postpositively, that is, following the noun it modifies in the manner of most adjectives in French.
The British political writer and former M.P. David Marquand described the mid-20th century Labour politician Aneurin Bevan as a "statesman manqué", while the magazine "Private Eye" referred to journalist Janet Street-Porter as an "architect manquée".
The "Collins Dictionary" gave the example of a manager as an "actor "manqué"", while the "Oxford Dictionary of Foreign Words and Phrases" cited the "Times" magazine in 1996 as describing a "subway genius" as "a writer manqué since many of his chosen citations deal with creating literature". Arising from the inscription on Plato's door in Ancient Greece, "let no one devoid of geometry enter here", the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes has been described as typifying a "mathematician "manqué"".
In Vladimir Nabokov's "Lolita", the narrator, Humbert Humbert, reminisces, "At first, I planned to take a degree in psychiatry as many "manqué" talents do; but I was even more "manqué" than that . . . and I switched to English literature."
In French "manqué" is sometimes applied to someone who has failed to gain professional status - such as "un médecin manqué" (a failed doctor) - whereas, in English, it need not have that pejorative implication. In the game of roulette the set of numbers from 1 to 18 is described as "manque" (no accent), meaning that the ball has "failed" to land in one of the higher (19-36) slots.
The slang "manky", meaning "inferior" or "dirty", is thought to be linked in some way to "manqué", possibly from the Scots word "mank" (maimed or defective) but maybe via Polari. The ancestor of all these words is the Latin "mancus" (maimed or crippled; and, by transference, imperfect or incomplete ).

Albert Goldsmid

Colonel Albert Edward Williamson Goldsmid, MVO (6 October 1846 – 27 March 1904) was a British officer. He was the founder of the Jewish Lads' Brigade (in 1895) and the Maccabaeans.
Albert Goldsmid was born in Poona, India, the son of Jessie Sarah (née Goldsmit) and Henry Edward Goldsmid. Both of his parents were the great-grandchildren of Aaron Goldsmid, the founder of the Goldsmid family, and his mother was the sister of Major-General Frederic John Goldsmid. His American-born maternal grandmother, Eliza Frances Campbell, was the granddaughter of Revolutionary War aide-de-camp David Franks. His father and maternal grandfather were born Jewish, and had converted to Christianity to achieve social and economic opportunities that were denied Jews. As an adult, Goldsmid converted to Judaism and always maintained that being Jewish had not impinged upon his military career. In his later years, he identified himself as the living personification of George Eliot's "Daniel Deronda". Eliot's book was transformative for Zionist development and understanding amongst Jews and non-Jews. Goldsmid's wife, Ida Stewart Hendriks, was also a convert to Judaism; she had been raised a Christian by her Protestant mother and Jewish-born father (Ida Hendriks' paternal great-great-great-grandfather had also been Aaron Goldsmid).
Goldsmid is buried at the Willesden United Synagogue Cemetery, London. He was the great-grandfather of American-born entertainer Christopher Guest, who succeeded as the 5th Baron Haden-Guest in 1996.
In June 1866, having passed out from Sandhurst, Goldsmid was commissioned into the 104th Foot. He became adjutant of battalion in 1871, captain in May, 1878, major in 1883, lieutenant-colonel in 1888, and colonel on 21 April 1894. In 1892 Colonel Goldsmid was selected by Baron de Hirsch to supervise the Jewish colonies in Argentina, but retired from the task to take up his appointment as colonel-in-command of the Welsh regimental district at Cardiff in 1894. In 1897 he was promoted chief of staff, with the grade of assistant adjutant-general in the Thames district.
At the departure of the Aldershot staff with Sir Redvers Buller in the conflict with the Boers in 1899, he acted as chief staff-officer at the camp at Aldershot, and was entrusted with the duties of mobilization. In December, 1899, when the sixth division of the South-African field force was mobilized, Goldsmid was selected as chief staff-officer to General Thomas Kelly-Kenny with the grade of assistant adjutant-general, and in that capacity was present at the battle of Paardeberg. During the earlier stages of the war he was commandant of the Orange River, Herbert, and Hay districts, 1900. After his service in South Africa, he was placed on half-pay in July 1901.
Goldsmid was the highest ranking Jewish officer in the British Army in the 19th century.
Colonel Goldsmid was an ardent Zionist, and head of the Hovevei Zion of Great Britain and Ireland. From 1896-1904 he was associated with Theodor Herzl as the head of the British Zionist movement and the key contact in the failed Zionist effort to establish a British Zionist protectorate in the Northern Sinai area of El Arish.

Tandridge, Surrey

Tandridge is a village and civil parish in Surrey, England. Its nucleus is on a rise of the Greensand Ridge between Oxted and Godstone. It includes, towards its middle one named sub-locality (hamlet), Crowhurst Lane End.
In landmarks it has one of the oldest yew trees in the country, a Grade I-listed church and the tomb of the church's main benefactor Sir George Gilbert Scott's wife, Lady Scott who lived in the parish. The village is acknowledged locally for its friendly atmosphere and sense of community. There is active use of the village hall from the annual Christmas show to many parties and social events. The Village fete and Bonfire events are well attended and add to the sense of village community.
The village lay within the Anglo-Saxon Tandridge hundred.
Tandridge appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as "Tenrige". It was held by the wife of Salie from Richard Fitz Gilbert. Its domesday assets were: 2 hides; 1 mill worth 4s 2d, 14 ploughs, of meadow, woodland and herbage worth 51 hogs. It rendered £11 per year to its feudal overlords.
Variant spellings such as in feet of fines (levied by the Crown and other overlords whenever rights or lands of manors were in a significant way parted with) include Tenrige; Tanerig, Tanerigge, Tanrich, Tenrig and Tenrugge in the Middle Ages. Godstone until the 19th century cut off a detached part, Tillingdon, which lay between Godstone and Caterham and became part of the latter community.
This small house of Austin canons was founded, Tandridge Priory in the time of Richard I of England. At Henry VIII's Dissolution of the monasteries it had possessions valued at £86. 7. 6. per annum. In the grounds of the priory are the lids of two stone coffins dug up here. In 1828 some silver and copper coins of Julius Caesar and other Roman emperors were found. Until about 1610 the property was held as part of the manor, but has since been owned separately.
Gilbert de Clare died in 1314 which triggered the division of his lands between his sisters and co-heirs: Eleanor wife of Hugh Despenser the Younger succeeded to the knights' fees belonging to (i.e. flowing yearly from) the manor. Tandridge's overlords remained (granting long tenancies of the manor) the Despensers and their descendants, the Beauchamps, thus over a century later, with mass property accumulation by holders of the Earldom of Warwick, it settled on the childhood prize of wealth in the country Anne de Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick. Due to the Cousins' Wars she became widow of Warwick the king-maker and was finally compelled to convey her enormous estates to Henry VII. In 1499 George Puttenham, who was afterwards knighted, was lord of the manor, as which he held courts in 1509 and 1527. He was succeeded at his death by his son Robert, who sold Tandridge in 1542 to John Cooke, a goldsmith of London, whose interest became assigned by mortgage (and default of payment) to Richard Bostock, who died without heirs. The manor became known by the name which it has since borne, Tandridge Court, to distinguish it from the manor of Tandridge Priory which had also become the property of Richard Bostock in the early 17th century. He left it to nephew Bostock Fuller, justice of the peace of Surrey who died in 1626.
William Clayton, nephew and heir to the manor at Bletchingley bought this supplemental manor in 1712 from Francis Fuller, he started a line of Clayton baronets by royal favour and the property was described as sold 'lately' by Sir William Robert Clayton to Walpole Greenwell, in 1912.
Tandridge Court was rebuilt in the 20th century and is not a listed building.
Sir Robert Clayton who owned the manor and the Priory granted the latter with Priory Farm (perhaps thus really only the latter) to Robert Graeme, his steward, and his heirs in return for the valuable services rendered by Graeme and because he had relinquished the profession for which he had been educated in order to become his steward. In 1817 Robert Graeme and Mary his wife conveyed the manor to Charles Hampden-Turner, in whose family it remained in 1912.
In John Rocque's map of 1761 'Woodcock's Hammer' is denoted what was the far south of the parish, near Hedgecourt (in Felbridge), showing that an iron forge stood there or had once done so.
In 1912 the parish was "chiefly agricultural, but there [we]re brick and tile works in it."
A clustered village partly surrounded by its own steep woodland otherwise by fields, the parish is largely on the lowest land of a noticeable ridge. It stretches as a long, thin parish south of the ridge towards Lingfield and Burstow. The north of this ridge close to the church is Beechwood Hill, at 160 metres above sea level, the 23rd highest hill in the county. The ridge is part of the Greensand Ridge which is patchy in Tandridge, the middle of its extent from the West Sussex/Hampshire border to South-East Kent.
Only one named hamlet is within the parish bounds, Crowhurst Lane End, approximately mid-way between the cluster of almost all of the homes of villagers who are not smallholders or large-scale farmers, and the centre of Crowhurst, Surrey. A footpath connects the village to the latter village and it is served by the local roads.
In the churchyard of Tandridge church is an ancient yew tree, of a size to indicate it is over 1,500 years old. It was measured as in 1912, quite hollow but "full of life with four great limbs above about four feet in height".
The nave is much of the late 11th century, with a wall and carved priest's door in the north of the chancel of the same date. The tower and spire form a rare example of timber construction, and one of the earliest of its class in Surrey, dating, in fact, from the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century.
In the churchyard are tombs/headstones/vaults to
The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

Buckland Hill Reservoir

Buckland Hill Reservoir is situated in Mosman Park, Western Australia. The covered reservoir is the most westerly in the Perth metropolitan area and provides sweeping views across Gage Roads of Rottnest Island, Garden Island and the Port of Fremantle and mouth of the Swan River to the west and Lucky Bay and Bicton and East Fremantle to the east. The reservoir was originally filled with water from Perth's hill dams and features a water treatment plant. Most of Perth's water supply is now sourced from groundwater aquifers in the Swan Valley. Buckland Hill supplies water to the area from Fremantle and Claremont.
The reservoir was built in 1925 on top of a limestone ridge adjacent to the Buckland Hill lighthouse. In 1935 the reservoir capacity was expanded from 4 million to 14 million gallons. The Buckland Hill obelisk, believed to have been constructed as a trig point and used in the hydrographic surveys of Gage Roads and Cockburn Sound in 1872-74, became an island when the reservoir was enlarged. When the reservoir was roofed in 1983 the obelisk was moved west to its current location.
The hill was originally of a much greater height but was quarried for limestone for the nearby Mt Lyell superphoshate works, which operated from 1910 to 1969. In 1941, the reservoir shared the hill with the Australian Army's Leighton Battery. The area around the reservoir is a popular parking place.

Bigfoot in popular culture

Bigfoot or Sasquatch, is an alleged ape-like creature purportedly inhabiting forests, mainly in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. More than forty-five years have passed since the first supposed sightings of Bigfoot were reported in California. The character of Bigfoot has been used frequently in popular culture including film, TV, advertising, and literature. Bigfoot has also been the subject of several tourism campaigns.
"Bigfoot" and "Sasquatch" are pop culture terms that have been used in advertising across many different products and services, such as pizzas, beef jerky, skateboards, skis, an Internet search engine, a computer hard drive series, gas stations, Kokanee beer, Bigfoot Shadows award winning wine and a monster truck.
Skamania County, Washington passed a law regarding Bigfoot in 1969 declaring that "any willful, wanton slaying of such creatures shall be deemed a felony" subject to substantial fine and/or imprisonment. The fact that this legislation was passed on April 1 did not escape notice, but County Commissioner Conrad Lundy said that "this is not an April Fool's Day joke ... there is reason to believe such an animal exists." Hunter and Dahinden mention their own "speculation that Skamania County authorities had their ears tuned much more to the music of a publicity bandwagon than to any song of distress" for Bigfoot. Notwithstanding, the ordinance was amended in 1984 to preclude an insanity defense and to consider such a killing homicide if the creature was proven by the coroner to be humanoid.

In response to Al Magnussen from the Mt. Baker Chamber of Commerce, Whatcom County, Washington, an Agenda Bill was drafted (92-247) on 6/9/91, which unanimously passed a resolution declaring Whatcom County a Sasquatch Protection and Refuge Area.
Many have written on the subject, demonstrating a broad spectrum of approaches from a small body of serious scholarly work to lurid tabloids, such as the "Weekly World News". "The Gwaii", published by Arcana Studio, is an award winning children's graphic novel that features a sasquatch named Tanu searching for his mother and tribe in the Canadian wilderness. John Prufrock, the hero of the comic book "Proof", is a Bigfoot who works for a secret agency that hunts and captures other cryptids. The comic, an ongoing series, was written by Alex Grecian and illustrated by Riley Rossmo. It was published by Image Comics from October 2007 to May 2011. "Donations to Clarity", a 2011 novel by Noah Baird, tells the story of a Bigfoot who falls in love with a Bigfoot hoaxer. In the non-canon "Star Wars Tales" comic "Into the Great Unknown" - in which the "Millennium Falcon", after a blind hyperspace jump," "crash-lands on what appears to be Endor but is in fact the Pacific Northwest around the time of Lewis and Clark, resulting in Han Solo's death at the hands of the natives and the eventual discovery of his body by Indiana Jones (who is disturbed by something "eerily familiar" about the remains) - "Sasquatch" is actually Chewbacca. One of the main characters from the Canadian Marvel Comics superhero team Alpha Flight is Sasquatch.
Sasquatch Books is the largest publishing house in the Pacific Northwest. Its logo features a Sasquatch paw print.
"Sasquatched! The Musical" is a musical play written and composed by Minnesota native Phil Darg in 2012. It follows the story of a gentle, dignified talking Sasquatch named Arthur, his interactions with the human characters of the surrounding Pacific Northwest area, and the issues revolving around Sasquatch-human relations. The style of the play is humorous, fast-moving, and family-friendly. The play was submitted as an entry to the New York Musical Theatre Festival in September 2012. In February, it was chosen as one of NYMF's Next Link selections and later received an award from the Anna Sosenko Assist Trust. In July 2013, the show was performed as part of NYMF at the Pearl Theatre in New York City.
There are annual Bigfoot-related conventions, and the creature plays a role in Pacific Northwest tourism, such as the annual "Sasquatch Daze" held for several years in Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia. Primatologist and Bigfoot researcher John Napier commented on this, stating that "Bigfoot in some quarters of North America has become big business ... It can no longer be considered simply as a natural phenomenon that can be studied with the techniques of a naturalist; the entrepreneurs have moved in and folklore has become fakelore."

Frederick Heiden

Count Frederick Maurice van Heiden (; 15 September 1821 – 18 January 1900) was a general of infantry in the Imperial Russian Army. He served as the Governor-General of Finland 1881–1898. Count van Heiden's 17-year office in the Grand Duchy of Finland encompassed the entire reign of Alexander III of Russia, who appointed him at the start of his own reign, to succeed the courtly and diplomatic Count Nikolay Adlerberg), and four first years of reign of Nicholas II of Russia.
Count van Heiden was born in Sveaborg, later renamed Suomenlinna, son of Dutch Lodewijk (Ludwig) Sigismund Gustavus van Heiden (b.September 6, 1772, Zuidlaren-d. November 5, Tallinn), who left Netherlands in 1795 during French invasion and settled in Livonia. Admiral van Heiden died in 1850. His mother was lady Anne-Marie Akeleye from a Danish family. Youngest son of family, count van Heiden, baptized as "Friedrich Moritz", took military career, and switched his religion from Protestantism to Eastern Orthodox, after which he was known by a Russian name "Fedor Logginovich".
Young Heiden fought in Caucasus and against the Hungarian Revolutionary Army, whom Nicholas I. assisted Austrian emperor against. He was promoted to colonel in 1849. During Crimean War Heiden was chief of staff in Baltic Corps, without participation in notable battles. After the war was he was promoted to Major General in 1855.
He married in 1854 countess Elisabeth Zubov (1833–1894) whose mother was countess Alexandra Raimond-Modène (1807–1839). Her father count Nikolay Dmitrievich Zubov (1801–1871; ) was Steward of the Russian Imperial Court, himself son of princess Paraskeva Viazemskaia and general, count Dmitri Alexandrovich Zubov, one of brothers of prince Platon Zubov.
Countess Elisabeth was a first cousin of countess Olga van Suchtelen, one of heiresses of that Finnish comital house whose males in 1860s became extinct.
After the war Heiden was chiefly a member of the General Staff. He participated in Dmitry Milyutin's military reforms and was appointed as head of the General Staff (Glavni Stab) in 1866. He also chaired the conscription committee that enacted the conscription in Russia in 1874, and was in charge of the mobilization during the Turkish War; he was acting Minister of War during Milyutin's absence during the Turkish War.
In 1870 Heiden was promoted to full General. When he was eleven years later appointed as Governor-General of Finland, he had made a long and successful military career.
As it was usual with persons who adopted themselves a new nationality, Heiden was eagerly Russian.
In his position in Finland, the Slavophile Heiden saw his task to Russify the country. However, his reputation among the Finns is not very bad, because of his subtle methods - his successor, general Bobrikov, enjoys a really contrasting fame of a russifying tyrant.
To attain his goal Heiden supported use of Finnish as language of administration, university and military, as opposed to Swedish. In appointments to public offices in government, administration, justice, and military he favored the conservative and monarchist Finnish Party and persons who had learned the Russian language well and resided longer times there, as opposed to possibly separatist Swedes and liberal Swedish Party. Heiden furthered trade between Finland and Russia, and had customs formalities reduced.
His chief interest was to clarify jurisdiction within Finland: to define what decisions belonged to the imperial government, what to autonomous local governments in Finland.

Portal:Strategy games/Intro

A strategy game is a game in which the player's decision-making influences the outcome significantly. They are usually board games, computer or video games, card games, or another type of game. Several games include strategy extensively, while others to a lesser degree, complicating demarcation. It is sometimes more accurate to say that some games have strategic elements, rather than being a strategy game; however, this depends on the game. The deciding factor separating strategy game from other genres is that there is either no or relatively less chance involved. Usually, the only physical element is the interaction with the game pieces, although there are exceptions. Players have similar starting positions or sitiuations, but use strategy to gain advantages over others. Strategy, as well as tactics, is dissimilar to luck in that chance-based games rely more heavily on probability. The word "strategy" is used by the military, and refers to high-level planning. Strategy games often deal with small-scale situations. Tactical games, a type of strategy game, deal with military planning, though also on a smaller scale than the military.

Morgan Fisher

Stephen Morgan Fisher (born 1 January 1950, Mayfair, London) is an English keyboard player and composer, and is most known as a member of Mott the Hoople in the early 1970s. However, his career has covered a wide range of musical activities, and he is still active in the music industry. In recent years he has expanded into photography.
From 1966 to 1970, Fisher played the organ with the soul / pop band, The Soul Survivors, who in 1967 renamed themselves Love Affair. They had a number one hit single in 1968 with "Everlasting Love", while Fisher was taking a break from the band to complete his final year at Hendon County Grammar school. Between 1972 and 1973 he formed the progressive rock band called Morgan, with singer Tim Staffell (the vocalist with the band Smile, who later became Queen).
From 1973 to 1976, after a brief liaison with Third Ear Band, he joined British rock band Mott the Hoople. Meanwhile, Fisher contributed keyboards to John Fiddler's Medicine Head, and when Mott folded, Fisher invited Fiddler to join the remaining members of Mott in what would become British Lions. From 1977 to 1979 the Lions recorded two albums, and three singles: Kim Fowley's "International Heroes", Garland Jeffries' "Wild in the Streets", and Fiddler's own "One More Chance to Run". In 1980, Fisher conceived and produced the unique "Miniatures" album (51 one-minute tracks by Robert Fripp, Gavin Bryars, Michael Nyman, The Pretenders, XTC, Penguin Cafe Orchestra, Robert Wyatt, Ivor Cutler, The Damned etc.). A sequel was released in 2000. In addition he played with Queen on their 1982 tour of Europe, and Freddie Mercury can be seen humorously introducing him to the audience just before the band's performance of "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the band's "Queen on Fire - Live at the Bowl" album.
In 1985, Fisher moved to Japan, and started to make ambient and improvised music. He became a TV commercial music songwriter, including songs written or arranged for Cat Power, Karin Krog, José Feliciano, Zap Mama and Swing Out Sister. Japanese artists he has worked with include Yoko Ono, Dip in the Pool, The Boom, Heat Wave, Shoukichi Kina, Haruomi Hosono and Kokoo. He also scored the Japanese anime/live-action hybrid film, "Twilight of the Cockroaches" (1987) and the documentary, "A Zen Life: D.T. Suzuki" (2006).
Starting in November 2003 Morgan performed 100 monthly solo improvisation concerts at the cutting-edge arts/music club Superdeluxe in Roppongi, Tokyo. He called this concert series Morgan's Organ, and has started to release live recordings of the series as downloads. The series ended in March 2013 and has been continued as Morgan's Organ At Home at his personal studio in Tokyo since June 2013.
In 2005, he collaborated with German musician Hans-Joachim Roedelius (of Cluster and Harmonia) on the ambient album "Neverless" (on the Klanggalerie label).
Fisher has maintained a lifelong interest in photography and in recent years has been holding an increasing number of solo exhibitions of his work in Japan and abroad. He has evolved a technique of abstract photography which he calls Light Painting, influenced by the photograms of Man Ray and László Moholy-Nagy, by pendulum-created harmonographs, and in particular by the abstract cinema of Len Lye, Norman McLaren and Oskar Fischinger. Unlike most light painting, where images are created by "drawing" with flashlights, etc., in front of a camera with an open shutter, Fisher's works are in the main created by moving the camera in front of various natural and man-made light sources (fireworks, sunlight on water, city illuminations, etc.). Many of his light paintings may be seen at his art website, and several were used in the booklet of his March 2009 album release "Non Mon", a collection of his most well-known TV commercial compositions (Japan, DefSTAR/Sony Records). His light paintings are on the front cover and in a seven-page spread in the Winter 2010 edition of "Artworks Magazine" (Carmel, California). In Spring 2014 they occupied 20 pages of the photograph magazine "Victor" published by the Hasselblad camera company. He exhibited in the spring of 2013 at the Hasselblad Gallery in Tokyo.

Europa Aircraft

Europa Aircraft is a British kitplane manufacturer that produces the Europa XS.
The company was established to produce a small kit-built low-wing aircraft for personal use within Europe, with these design goals: high speed, low cost, able to be built and stored at home, easily transportable, using Mogas fuel, able to be rigged for flight in under five minutes, carrying two people in comfort, providing sufficient baggage for extended touring. Apart from "low cost", these design parameters were largely met.
Europa Aircraft has existed under several company names, the current name is "Europa Aircraft (2004) Ltd". The manufacturing of the Europa range of aircraft is carried out by a sister company, Aviation and Marine Engineering Ltd. Both companies are located in the same premises.
The original Europa, (the "Classic"), was designed by Ivan Shaw and the prototype first flew in February 1992. Production was established at the company's factory in Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire.
Ivan Shaw left Europa to develop the Europa-derivative Liberty XL2 production aircraft at a new company, Liberty Aerospace, in Melbourne, Florida, United States. After he left, the firm faced considerable difficulties; but in September 2008, company fortunes improved as Europa Aircraft was acquired by British company, Swift Technology Group. Other companies within the Group include Swift Aircraft, Swift TG Solutions and Aviation and Marine Engineering Ltd.
In the early 1990s the company was grant by the UK Department of Trade and Industry in recognition of its technical achievements. Europa Aircraft has grown to be one of the most successful British kit plane suppliers, with over 700 Europas flying in 33 countries. The Europa XS was named as one of the UK's Millennium Products by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair, and described by Pilot magazine as "the most significant light plane of the decade".

Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara

Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara (OEF-TS) is the name of the military operation conducted by the United States and partner nations in the Sahara/Sahel region of Africa, consisting of counterterrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa. It is part of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The other OEF mission in Africa is Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA).
The Congress approved $500 million for the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative (TSCTI) over six years to support countries involved in counterterrorism against alleged threats of al-Qaeda operating in African countries, primarily Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Nigeria, and Morocco. This program builds upon the former Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI), which concluded in December 2004 and focused on weapon and drug trafficking, as well as counterterrorism. TSCTI has both military and non-military components to it. OEF-TS is the military component of the program. Civil affairs elements include USAID educational efforts, airport security, Department of the Treasury, and State Department efforts.
Canada deployed teams of less than 15 CSOR members to Mali throughout 2011 to help combat militants in the Sahara. Although the special forces will not engage in combat, they will train the Malian military in basic soldiering. Areas include communications, planning, first aid, and providing aid to the general populace.
Operation Enduring Freedom Trans Sahara is primarily a training mission meant to equip 10 nations to combat insurgents in the region. Africa Command states:
Twice a year, the Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) program holds a multinational training exercise. Called Flintlocks, these exercises are meant to strengthen special forces from the United States as well as multiple other nations. Participants include troops from the Sahel and those from NATO members. Flintlock started in 1988 and continued through Operation Enduring Freedom, and is now held in Africa. The exercises teach medical operations, infantry and peacekeeping training, airborne operations, humanitarian relief, and leadership skills. The amount each category is stressed depends on the host nation's needs. In addition, participants are put through different scenarios involving skills instructed during the exercise.
Mali was supposed to host the 2012 exercise, but the United States decided to postpone the exercise. Officials say Flintlock was postponed because Mali is facing a renewed Tuareg insurgency.
Although the Flintlock Exercise was postponed, another training program in Mali was not. The Atlas Accord was created in 2012 to train African military personnel in a number of skills while focusing on logistics. The exercise includes classroom instruction and field instruction. Atlas Accord 12 focused solely on logistics and aerial resupply, while the next exercise in 2013 will continue training in aerial logistics but will also include command, control, communications, and computer (C4) techniques.
The largest training exercise, African Lion, is an annual security cooperation exercise held by the US and Morocco. Created in 2008, this program is designed to instruct a variety of skills, including aerial logistics, non-lethal weapons training, combined arms and maneuver exercises. More than 900 Moroccans and 1,200 Americans take part in the two week exercise.

Web-based taxonomy

Web-based taxonomy is the effort by taxonomists to use the World Wide Web in order to create unified, consensus taxonomies of life on Earth.
In his 2002 paper on the subject, H. Charles J. Godfray called for the creation of Web-based organisations to collect all the accumulated literature on a taxonomic group into a centralized knowledge base and make this data available through the Web as a unified taxonomy, so that it can be more easily examined and revised. Such a platform would be owned and maintained by a taxonomic working group, governed by an editor or an editorial board. An example of such a platform is FishBase.
The notion of Web-based consensus taxonomies remains controversial because, as two Australian researchers pointed out, taxonomic names are not fixed but hypotheses, and therefore in constant change.

American College Higher Secondary School

American College High School commonly known as AC school is one of India's oldest schools. Established in British colonial times in the south Indian city of Madurai.
For many years AC school has been noted for its sporting talents. The students from Sports Hostel run by the Sports Authority of Tamil Nadu in the premises of Race Course stadium in Madurai undergo their education in AC School. The sports hostels houses young talents in Athletics, Basketball and Football. Other than that AC school is one of the mightiest cricket playing schools in this part of Tamil Nadu.
The football team powered by the coaching of Sports hostel has achieved many milestones in the state. In 1992 the AC school guys beat the YMCA club of Chennai in a fascinating thriller at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Tiruchirapalli in a tournament final. In those days YMCA was represented by professional footballers from all parts of the country. Then Head master of AC school Mr. Appa Samy announced a holiday to celebrate this victory.
For more than 15 years AC school dominated the Madurai Educational district cricket tournament by winning the Champions title continuously for 14 years. Many AC school alumnus play in A and B division of Madurai District Cricket Association league.
Though it doesn’t have a strong hockey team, the school produced great talents in hockey. Illango, an AC school alumnus has represented India-under-19 team in hockey.
This school in the same manner has many talented teachers who knows how to make students concentrate both on studies and sports.The PT masters play a great role in bringing the school in the sports arena.

Hi, this is my first biographical article, and just the 2nd proper article over all. I have ideas for several other new articles in my mind, but I wanted to get this one checked before I proceeded with the others. I've tried to keep in mind all the criteria of good article in mind when creating this, but since I'm new, I'm sure they'll be things I can improve on, so I'll appreciate a review. Thanks in advance. 13:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
Good start. I fixed some of the automated suggestions, above. Try to be more specific - the names of her father and mother and son are not given, (nor is it made clear if her name changed on marriage or her maiden name if different - is this the custom in Afghanistan?). Her college education is not mentioned until she is scrubbing floors. Also missing are her date of birth (as noted above), her birth-order in her family (is she the oldest cild, youngest, second, etc.), and the dates (not just years) of her pageant win, marriage, flights to Germany and the USA, etc. I would also copyedit it carefully as there are many unclear or awkward sentences (the can help). I would also use the correct title of wikilinks that are redirects (i.e. TV -> television). Some examples of unclear sentences: "Her father was a Columbia University graduate doctor, and Afghanistan's surgeon general and her mother also belonged to a well-known family." How about "Her father, Joe Yousuf, was Afghanistan's surgeon general and a Columbia University trained physician, from a family known for... Her mother, Mary Jones Yousuf... then say why her mother's family was well known and give reference(s). Second example: "But as the pageant gained popularity, she decided to enter and eventually landed the title because of her intelligent responses during the question and answer session." If this was the first pageant, how did it gain popularity? Eventually makes it sound like the pageant was a multiday or weeklong event. This also needs a reference - all the refs are in one section and one external link needs to be converted to an inline ref. I hope this helps, keep up the good work! 15:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
Great initiative ! In my opinion, you did a good job of writing the article. However, more references and some grammar copyedits might help. For example, "Her father was a Columbia University graduate doctor, and Afghanistan's surgeon general and her mother also belonged to a well-known family." appears to be a run-on sentence. Also, readers might find an image to be a great addition to the article. Keep up the good work. Thanks, 20:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

John Oliver Wheeler

John Oliver Wheeler (19 December 1924 – 24 May 2015) was an award-winning Canadian geologist, who spent most of his career as a research scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada.
Wheeler came from a family of surveyors. His father, Sir Edward Oliver Wheeler, participated in the first topographical survey of Mount Everest in 1921, and later rose to become Surveyor General of India. Wheeler's grandfather, Arthur Oliver Wheeler, mapped British Columbia’s Selkirk Mountains and the British Columbia-Alberta border.
In 1952, Wheeler joined the Geological Survey of Canada. He worked for them for 39 years. He spent the first 20 years mapping the geology of 100,000 square kilometres. The greatest part of this achievement was the Cordillera from northern Washington to eastern Alaska. He also mapped several regions of the Yukon, including the Saint Elias Mountains, and parts of British Columbia, including the Selkirk Mountains. His work has become the foundation of all subsequent Cordilleran mapping studies and set the standard for geological mapping in Canada. In 1968, Wheeler was appointed head of the Survey’s Cordilleran Section.
In the 1970s, Wheeler moved to Ottawa to become a manager. He was promoted to Chief Geologist, with responsibility for the scientific program. In the 1980s he returned to Vancouver to be the General Editor of the new 8-volume edition of the "Geology of Canada". He prepared many of the large regional and national maps.
In the early 1980s, he lobbied for establishment of the Lithoprobe project. This 20-year project performed geoscientific studies on and mapped deep seismic transects of Canada’s crust. He served as chairman of Lithoprobe’s steering committee for two years.
Wheeler retired in 1990. During his later years he remainined as an unsalaried emeritus research scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada in Vancouver, and was a lead author of the 2004 Canada-USA collaborative Geological Map of North America.
Wheeler became a member of the Geological Association of Canada in 1957. He was a Councillor from 1968-1972. He served as President from 1970-1971.

Dracula (1924 play)

Dracula is a 1924 stage play adapted by Hamilton Deane from the novel of the same name by Bram Stoker, and substantially revised by John L. Balderston in 1927. It was the first adaptation of the novel authorised by Stoker's widow, and has influenced many subsequent adaptations.
The original production starred Raymond Huntley as Dracula; Deane had originally intended to play the title role himself, but in the event opted for the role of Van Helsing. This production toured England for three years before settling in London.
In 1927 the play was brought to Broadway by Horace Liveright, who hired John L. Balderston to revise the script for American audiences. The American production starred Bela Lugosi in his first major English-speaking role, with Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing; both actors reprised their roles in the 1931 film version, which drew on the Deane-Balderston play.
In addition to radically compressing the plot, the 1927 rewrite by Balderston, reduced the number of significant characters, combining Lucy Westenra and Mina Murray into a single character, making John Seward this Lucy's father, and disposing of Quincey Morris and Arthur Holmwood.In Dean's original version Quincey was changed to a female to provide work in the play for more actresses.
The play was revived in 1977, in a production featuring set and costume designs by Edward Gorey and starring Frank Langella as Dracula. The production won Tony Awards for Best Revival and Best Costume Design, and was nominated for Best Scenic Design and Best Leading Actor in a Play (Langella). Langella, like Lugosi, went on to reprise the role in the 1979 film version. Subsequent actors in the title role for the Broadway revival included David Dukes, Raul Julia and Jean LeClerc, while the London production starred Terence Stamp and American touring companies starred Martin Landau and Jeremy Brett.

The Reminder

The Reminder is the third full-length album by indie artist Feist. It was released on April 23, 2007 in countries outside of North America, and May 1, 2007 in the United States and Canada.
Following its release, it debuted on the U.S. "Billboard" 200 at number 16, selling about 31,000 copies in its first week, and debuted at number 2 in Canada, selling just over 18,000 copies. As of July 25, 2011, the album has sold 729,000 copies in the US. "The Reminder" was also the best selling album of 2007 on the iTunes Store.
On November 25, 2008, the Deluxe Edition released as a two-disc package featuring nine bonus tracks on the second disc.
Track 6 of the album, "Sealion" is an adaptation of a song by singer Nina Simone ("Broadway-Blues-Ballads", 1964). The original title was "See Line Woman" (a reference to sealions was never intended), and refers to the life of an upper class prostitute.
Confirmed singles include "My Moon My Man", "1234", "I Feel It All" and "Honey Honey". The "My Moon My Man" single includes a remix by German electronic musician Boys Noize. Videos were directed by Patrick Daughters, who also directed the video for "Mushaboom". During September 2007, the song "1234" was featured in Apple's television advertisement for the third generation iPod nano. The advert caused a sudden increase in the song's popularity, which resulted in a surge in the song's chart position. It reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart on October 7 and number 8 in the "Billboard" Hot 100 for the week ending October 13. The music video was shot in a single unbroken take after two days of rehearsals. "Time" magazine named "1234" one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at #2. The song was written by Australian artist Sally Seltmann (aka New Buffalo). Writer Josh Tyrangiel called the song a “masterpiece”, praising Feist for singing it “with a mixture of wisdom and exuberance that's all her own." eBay also used the song in Australian advertisements. Another single, "My Moon My Man" was used in a Verizon Wireless commercial.
This album was No. 35 on "Rolling Stone"s list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007.
On July 10, 2007, the shortlist for the Polaris Music Prize was revealed. "The Reminder" was announced as a finalist, alongside such other acts as The Besnard Lakes, Chad VanGaalen, and eventual winner Patrick Watson.
Kaleefa Saneh of "The New York Times" ranked "The Reminder" at #1, and John Pareles ranked it at No. 2 on list of the 10 Best Albums of 2007.
Less than a year after its release, "Blender" listed it 80th on their list of The 100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums Ever. Online music magazine Pitchfork Media placed "The Reminder" at number 112 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s.
Feist won the 2007 Shortlist Music Prize for "The Reminder"; she is the second woman (after Cat Power) to ever win the award.
It won Juno Awards in 2008 for Pop Album of the Year and for Album of the Year. After winning her 5 Junos, in Canada her album sales shot back up the chart from No. 12 to No. 2, the position her album debuted at. It was also nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 50th Grammy Awards.
All songs written by Feist, except where noted.
"Sealion" contains elements from 'Sea Lion Woman' by George Bass and Nina Simone.
The following tracks were not on the CD or 12" vinyl formats, but were available for download from iTunes only with the purchase of the album from the iTunes Store or Starbucks.
The following tracks were available as bonus downloads via a code included with initial copies of "The Reminder" in US Best Buy stores. The live versions of "Intuition" and "Honey Hone" are the same versions as those found as bonus tracks on the UK and Japanese CDs.

Leona Woods

Leona Harriet Woods (August 9, 1919 – November 10, 1986), later known as Leona Woods Marshall and Leona Woods Marshall Libby, was an American physicist who helped build the first nuclear reactor and the first atomic bomb.
At age 23, she was the youngest and only female member of the team which built and experimented with the world's first nuclear reactor (then called a "pile"), Chicago Pile-1, in a project led by her mentor Enrico Fermi. In particular, Woods was instrumental in the construction and then utilization of geiger counters for analysis during experimentation. She was the only woman present when the reactor went critical. She worked with Fermi on the Manhattan Project, and, together with her first husband John Marshall, she subsequently helped solve the problem of xenon poisoning at the Hanford plutonium production site, and supervised the construction and operation of Hanford's plutonium production reactors.
After the war, she became a fellow at Fermi's Institute for Nuclear Studies. She later worked at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey, the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and New York University, where she became a professor in 1962. Her research involved high-energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. In 1966 she divorced Marshall and married Nobel laureate Willard Libby. She became a professor at the University of Colorado, and a staff member at RAND Corporation. In later life she became interested in ecological and environmental issues, and she devised a method of using the isotope ratios in tree rings to study climate change. She was a strong advocate of food irradiation as a means of killing harmful bacteria.
Leona Harriet Woods was born on a farm in La Grange, Illinois on August 9, 1919, the second of five children of Weightstill Arno Woods, a lawyer, and his wife Mary Leona Holderness Woods. She had two sisters and two brothers. She graduated from Lyons Township High School in La Grange at 14, and received her BS in chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1938, at the age of 18.
After passing her qualifying exams in chemistry, she approached the Nobel Prize for Physics laureate James Franck about being his graduate student, having been impressed by a talk he gave in 1939 on Brillouin zones. Franck accepted, but told her that when he was young his professor had warned him that as a Jewish academic, he would starve to death. Franck therefore warned Woods that "You are a woman and you will starve to death." Despite the fact that Franck did not look malnourished, she took the warning seriously, and decided to instead become a graduate student of Robert Mulliken, who would one day become a Nobel laureate himself.
Mulliken allowed her to choose her own research problem, and edited the final version before it appeared in the "Physical Review". Her doctoral thesis, "On the Silicon Oxide Bands", prepared under the supervision of Mulliken and Polish chemist Stanisław Mrozowski was accepted in 1943. Mulliken, she later recalled, had twice told her "that perhaps not all he taught me was wasted." His students, she noted, "agree that this is his highest praise."
By 1942, when she was finishing writing up her thesis, she was the youngest and last of Mulliken's pre-war students, and was working alone because all her fellow students had become involved with war work. She met Herbert Anderson, who was working for Enrico Fermi. The two would go swimming together in Lake Michigan every afternoon at 5 pm. Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research, and as soon as her PhD was finished, he hired her to work with the boron trifluoride detectors used to measure neutron flux.
Fermi's group constructed a nuclear reactor known as Chicago Pile-1 under the stands of Stagg Field, the University's abandoned football stadium, where Woods had once played squash. Walter Zinn did not want a woman involved in the dirty work of placing the graphite blocks, but Woods had plenty of work to do with the detectors and thermocouples, and used a small stack of graphite of her own to measure the effects of a radium-beryllium source on manganese foil to obtain a measure of the neutron cross section in order to calibrate the detectors. Woods was the only woman present when the reactor went critical, asking Fermi "When do we become scared?"
Laura Fermi remembered Woods as "a tall young girl built like an athlete, who could do a man's job and do it well. She was the only woman physicist in Enrico's group. At that time, her mother, who was also endowed with inexhaustible energy, was running a small farm near Chicago almost by herself. To relieve Mrs. Woods of some work, Leona divided her time between atoms and potatoes."
Like many scientists working on the project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her white blood cell count halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.
Woods married John Marshall in July 1943. Soon after, she fell pregnant. While she told Enrico Fermi, they agreed not to let Walter Zinn know, for fear that he would insist that she leave the reactor building. She covered up her pregnant belly with her baggy denim work clothes. She rode to work each day on an unheated Army bus, "arriving each morning barely in time to vomit before starting the day's work." The child, a boy called Peter, was born in 1944. She returned to work a few days later.
A team from Argonne was on hand for powering up the first reactor at the Hanford Site, where large reactors would produce plutonium for bombs. They watched the reactor in shifts, with John Marshall and others on the day shift, Enrico Fermi and Leona Marshall on the night shift, ending at midnight, and Don Hughes and John Wheeler on the swing shift. While the Marshalls were babysitting the reactor in Hanford, they left Peter with Leona's mother.
The reactor was powered up successfully, but after a few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a radioactive poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison, which turned out to be xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get the reactor started.
Asked many years later about how she felt about her involvement in the Manhattan Project, she said:
After the war, Leona Marshall returned to the University of Chicago, where she became a fellow at Fermi's Institute for Nuclear Studies. Working with the Chicago Pile 3 heavy water reactor, she found a way to 100 percent spin polarize neutron beams, and determined the refractive index of neutrons for various materials. Her second child, John Marshall III, was born in 1949. She became an assistant professor in 1953.
After Fermi died in 1954, the Marshalls separated. John Marshall returned to the Los Alamos Laboratory, while Leona, now effectively a single mother, became a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey in 1957. The following year she became a fellow at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, at a time when the focus of research in physics was shifting away from the nucleus and towards elementary particles. In 1960, she joined New York University as an associate professor of physics. She became a professor in 1962.
Three years later, she became a professor at the University of Colorado, researching high-energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. She then became a staff member at RAND Corporation, where she worked until 1976. In 1966, she divorced John Marshall, and married Willard Libby, who had won the Nobel prize in 1960. She later joined him at UCLA, where she became a visiting professor of environmental studies, engineering, engineering archaeology, mechanical aerospace and nuclear engineering in 1973.
Now known as Leona Marshall Libby, she became interested in ecological and environmental issues, and she devised a method of using the isotope ratios of Oxygen-18 to Oxygen-16, Carbon-13 to Carbon-12, and Deuterium to Hydrogen in tree rings to study changes in temperature and rainfall patterns hundreds of years before records were kept, opening the door to the study of climate change.
Like Willard Libby, she was a strong advocate of food irradiation as a means of killing off harmful bacteria, and advocated that legal and regulatory restrictions on its use be relaxed. She proposed that, instead of it being sprayed with malathion, fruit affected by the Mediterranean fruit fly could be treated with gamma rays.
She was a prolific author, publishing over 200 scientific papers. While at RAND she wrote a paper on "Creation of an Atmosphere for the Moon" (1969). Her works include the autobiographical "The Uranium People" (1979), a history of early atomic research. After Libby died in 1980, she edited his papers with Rainer Berger, and published "The Life Work of Nobel Laureate Willard Libby" (1982). Her last paper, on quasi-stellar objects, appeared in 1984.
She died at St. John's Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, on November 10, 1986, from an anesthesia-induced stroke. She was survived by her sons Peter and John, and four grandchildren. She also had two stepdaughters, Janet Eva Libby and Susan Charlotte Libby from her second marriage.

Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria

Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria (4 December 1808 – 15 November 1888), known informally as Max in Bayern, was a member of a junior branch of the House of Wittelsbach and a promoter of Bavarian folk-music. He is most famous today as the father of Empress Elisabeth of Austria ("Sisi").
Maximilian Joseph was born at Bamberg, the only son of Duke Pius August in Bavaria (1786–1837) and of his wife, Princess Amélie Louise of Arenberg. On September 9, 1828, at Tegernsee, Maximilian Joseph married Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. They had ten children.
In 1834 he purchased Possenhofen Castle on Lake Starnberg; this was his major residence for the rest of his life. In 1838 he acquired Unterwittelsbach Castle (today housing a "Sisi" museum) near the site of Burg Wittelsbach, the ancestral seat of the House of Wittelsbach. Maximilian Joseph died in Munich. He and his wife are buried in the family crypt in Tegernsee Abbey, a former monastery which Ludovika's father, King Maximilian I Joseph, had acquired in 1817. At the same time of the secularisation, Duke Maximilian Joseph's grandfather Duke Wilhelm in Bavaria had also purchased a former monastery, Banz Abbey. Both properties, Tegernsee and Banz, are still today owned by Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria.
In 1838 Maximilian Joseph travelled to Egypt and Palestine. He published an account of this trip: "Wanderung nach dem Orient im Jahre 1838" (München: Georg Franz, 1839; reprinted Pfaffenhofen: Ludwig, 1978). While climbing the Great Pyramid he arranged for his servants to yodel as if he were climbing in the Alps. He collected a number of antiquities which he brought back to Bavaria and displayed in his father's home, Banz Abbey; they can still be seen there today. Among the items are the mummy of a young woman, three mummies' heads, several animal mummies, shawabtis, and several stones from tombs or temples including one from the Temple of Dendur. He also bought some children in the Cairo slave market and later freed them. When Maximilian Joseph was in Jerusalem, he paid for the restoration of the Church of the Flagellation on the Via Dolorosa.
Maximilian Joseph was one of the most prominent promoters of Bavarian folk-music in the 19th century. Under his influence the zither started to be used in court circles and eventually became identified as the national musical instrument of Bavaria. Because of his interest he received the nickname "Zither-Maxl". He himself played the zither and also composed music for it.
During a visit by his cousin Ludwig II of Bavaria, Ludwig saw some sheet music on Maximilian Joseph's piano by the composer Richard Wagner, which led on to Ludwig's financial support for Wagner from 1863.
Maximilian Joseph's musical compositions have been collected in the work: "Die im Druck erschienenen Kompositionen von Herzog Maximilian in Bayern: Ländler, Walzer, Polka, Schottisch, Mazurka, Quadrillen und Märsche für Pianoforte, Zither, Gitarre oder Streichinstrumente" (München: Musikverlag Emil Katzbichler, 1992).

Calcaria

Calcaria was a small town in the Roman province of Britannia. Today, it is known as Tadcaster, located in the English county of North Yorkshire.
The Romans founded the settlement and named it "Calcaria" from the Latin word for "lime kilns", reflecting the importance of the area's Magnesian Limestone geology as a natural resource for quarrying. The nature of the settlement is uncertain. It is possible that it started as an Imperial staging post with a mansio because of its location at a river crossing on the road from Danum (Doncaster) to Eburacum (York). Just to the north-west is the Roman fort at Newton Kyme (possibly Praesidium) dating from the 4th century. Mileages on the Antonine Itinerary suggest that Calcaria may have lain well west of Tadcaster.

René Thomas (guitarist)

René Thomas (25 February 1927 in Liege, Belgium – 3 January 1975 in Spain) is considered one of the greatest jazz guitarists of the 1960s, but has remained rather unknown to the general public. After the Second World War, he played with the "Bop Shots", Belgium's first be-bop outfit with Jacques Pelzer and Bobby Jaspar. Between these three men a real musical osmosis arose.
In the early 1950s, Thomas moved to Paris where he connected with the modern jazz scene. In 1954, he recorded his first album under his own name. His reputation as a virtuoso guitarist and inventive musician spread rapidly in the small jazz world.
In 1956, he moved to Canada. He played regularly for the Montreal jazz society and met American musicians, including Sonny Rollins, who becomes impressed enough to invite him for a concert in Philadelphia and for the recording, in 1958, of his "Sonny Rollins and the Big Brass" album. In the United States, René played with the best jazz musicians of that era: Stan Getz, Miles Davis, Toshiko Akiyoshi and Jackie McLean. In 1960, he recorded the album "Guitar Groove".
Returning to Europe in 1962, he toured and recorded with Chet Baker, Bobby Jaspar, Kenny Clarke, Eddy Louiss, Charles Lolo Bellonzi, Ingfried Hoffman, Stan Getz, Lucky Thompson, Sonny Criss, Jacques Pelzer and Lou Bennett.
He died on 3 January 1975 of a sudden heart attack in Spain, while touring with Lou Bennett.

Beinn Spionnaidh

Beinn Spionnaidh is a mountain of 773 m in Sutherland, the northwestern tip of the Scottish Highlands. It is a Corbett located west of Loch Eriboll and northeast of Cranstackie and Foinaven. It is like its neighbours in that the top, a 1 km long whaleback running southwest to northeast, is covered with loose, broken quartzite. A steep spur to the northwest, Cioch Mhor, provides one route to the top, and good views of the Kyle of Durness; the gentler slope to the southeast is tiring due to the loose rock on the upper section.

Edward Littleton, 2nd Baron Hatherton

Edward Richard Littleton, 2nd Baron Hatherton (31 December 1815 – 2 April 1888), was a British peer and Liberal Member of Parliament from the extended Littleton/Lyttelton family.
Hatherton was the son of Edward John Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton, and Hyacinthe Mary Wellesley, eldest illegitimate daughter of Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley. He was elected to the House of Commons for Walsall in 1847, a seat he held until 1852. He then represented Staffordshire Southern from 1853 until 1857. In 1863 he succeeded his father as second Baron Hatherton and entered the House of Lords. He was not so active a politician as his father and Hansard records only two interventions in Parliament - one in the Commons, and one in the Lords.
Lord Hatherton married Lady Margaret Percy, daughter of George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland, in 1841. He died in April 1888, aged 72, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Edward. Lady Hatherton died in 1897.

Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative

The Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative (TSCTI) is an interagency plan by the United States government, combining efforts by both civil and military agencies, "to combat terrorism in Trans-Saharan Africa. The military component of TSCTI comprises the U.S. efforts of Operation Enduring Freedom - Trans Sahara. The goal of TSCTI is to counter terrorist influences in the region and assist governments to better control their territory and to prevent huge tracts of largely deserted African territory from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups." The first partner nations in the program included Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Nigeria and Tunisia. Current membership includes eleven African countries: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal. The goal of the alliance is not to fight in hot spots, but to provide preventative training and engagement with governments to help prevent the growth of terrorist organizations in the partner countries. Exercise Flintlock 2005, a joint military exercise first held in June 2005, was the first result of the new program.
The Congress approved $500 million for the TSCTI over six years to support countries involved in counterterrorism against threats of Al Qaeda operating in central African countries. In February 2007, President George W. Bush also authorized the creation of a new Africa Command to be established by September 2007, under which future African continental operations would be conducted. TSCTI followed the Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI), which began in 2002 by training soldiers from Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad and concluded operations in December 2004.
Critics of the initiative have questioned of the extent and presence of Islamic-extremist terrorism in the region and the actions and past behavior of some of the partner governments, who may be using the program to gain training, equipment and funds in order to effectively control and repress legitimate democratic movements in member states, or to fuel wars between neighboring African countries. Similar questions were raised about the TSCTI's predecessor, the Pan Sahel Initiative.
On October 1, 2008, responsibility was transferred from the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) and the United States European Command (EUCOM) to the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM)
as it assumed authority over the African theater of operations.

Godfrey Thring

Godfrey Thring (25 March 1823 – 13 September 1903), was an Anglican clergyman and hymn writer.
Godfrey Thring was born at Alford, Somerset, the son of the rector, Rev. John Gale Dalton Thring and Sarah née Jenkyns. He was brother of Theodore Thring (1816–91), Henry, Lord Thring (1818–1907) (a noted jurist and Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury), Edward Thring (headmaster of Uppingham School) and John Charles Thring (a master at Uppingham School and deviser of the Uppingham Rules), and two sisters. The family is commemorated in Alford Church by carved choir seats in the chancel and two memorial windows.
He was educated at Shrewsbury School and graduated in 1845 from Balliol College, Oxford with a BA. He was ordained in the Anglican Church. In 1858 his father united the benefices of Alford and Hornblotton by an Act of Parliament styled the "Thrings Estate Bill" and Godfrey became his father's curate. He built Hornblotton Rectory for Godfrey in 1867.
Godfrey commissioned the architect Thomas Graham Jackson to build new churches at Hornblotton and Lottisham, and became, in Jackson's words, "one of my best and most valued friends". Jackson created for him a remarkable little church, rich in the Arts and Crafts style and strikingly decorated in sgraffito work.
Thring died in 1903 and was buried in Shamley Green, Surrey, England.
The town of Lovington, Somerset's history gives us a glimpse into the character of Thring:
But for the generosity of the Thring family a century ago the school would have gone short of books and materials for needlework and other necessities. The Rev Godfrey Thring worked constantly for the good of the children. He presented the school with a harmonium on which he could play his compositions and get the children to sing the hymns that he wrote.
Thring's poetry books include "Hymns Congregational and Others", 1866; "Hymns and Verses", 1866; "Hymns and Sacred Lyrics", 1874, "A Church of England Hymn-book Adapted to the Daily Services of the Church throughout the Year", 1880; and a revised "Church of England Hymn Book" in 1882.
He wrote many hymns including "The radiant morn has passed away" (set to music by Herbert Hall Woodward) and "Fierce raged the tempest o'er the deep". Although Matthew Bridges (1800–94) wrote the original verses to "Crown Him with Many Crowns", Thring added more verses. It is possible they met, but there is no record of them having done so. Both men are usually listed as the writers.

Andy Rolland

Andy Rolland (born 12 November 1942 in Cowdenbeath) is a Scottish former footballer who played as a right back.
Rolland began his senior career in 1961 with Cowdenbeath but was released at the end of the season. After a spell in junior football, he returned to Central Park in 1964 and remained for three seasons, before a £10,000 move to Dundee United in 1967. Rolland played at Tannadice for eleven seasons, picking up a Scottish Cup runners-up medal and making some 429 competitive appearances, putting him in the top ten for United players. In summer 1978, Rolland moved to the United States to play in the North American Soccer League, featuring for Fort Lauderdale Strikers and Los Angeles Aztecs, the latter involving a swap deal for George Best. Rolland returned to Scotland after the summer and signed for Dunfermline, although he experienced relegation in his first season. Midway through 1980-81, Rolland returned to Cowdenbeath for a third spell, becoming player/manager shortly afterwards. During that season, Rolland missed the all-important penalty in a match which denied Cowden promotion. Rolland left the club in March 1982, and later returned to junior football at the age of 40 with Leven Juniors.
Although Rolland never appeared for Scotland, he was selected for the Scottish League team against the Football League at Hampden in 1976. This was the final of these matches, as this occasion drew less than 9,000 spectators.

Château de Sarzay

The Château de Sarzay is a 14th-century castle in the village of Sarzay in the Indre "département" of France.
This imposing medieval fortress comprises 38 towers and three drawbridges. Numerous furnished rooms maintain their historical authenticity. From the tops of the towers, with their superb carpentry, one can discover the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Restored deep moats, the chapel and the hall complete the beauty of the site.
This small village in the Berry province acquired the title of 'City' in 1300. The parish was a dependency of the Archbishop of Bourges.
The manor of Sarzay belonged to the Barbançois family since the middle of the 14th century. They were a family of knights whose sons distinguished themselves in the battles of the Hundred Years War. The family built the castle and remained owners until 1720. Their title was promoted to marquis in 1651.
To begin with, the castle was open ground circled by a ditch and defended by an enclosure of which the only remnant is a chapel-tower. In 1360, the lord of Sarzy, Guillaume de Barbançois, fought the English outside the nearby town of La Châtre, before looting the town. Sarzay was at the edge of the kingdom of France, facing the English possessions of Poitou, Limousin and Aquitaine, and thus formed part of the first line of defence of the kingdom. Around 1440, Jean de Barbançois constructed a hall flanked with five towers, one of which served the various floors. The towers were crowned with machicolations. The castle contained the English invasion. Surviving intact from the Hundred Years War, the Wars of Religion, the Fronde and the French Revolution, it is today one of the most photographed monuments in France.
The castle was used as a setting by George Sand in her novel "le Meunier d'Angibault" (1845).
The castle on two hectares was bought in the end of 1982 by Richard Hurbain and his wife, Francoise, and their three sons for 790,000 francs. Hurbain pledged to restore the moats, build halls in the medieval style, and restore outbuildings as holiday accommodation. The castle is open to the public.
The Château de Sarzay has been classified since 1912 as a "monument historique" by the French Ministry of Culture.
An article on the castle and the restoration process (and the legal battles that ensued) appeared in "Smithsonian" magazine, January 1997, pages 64-73.

The Calthorpe Clinic is an abortion clinic in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England that first opened in 1969. It was the first clinic in the United Kingdom opened exclusively for abortions. It was erected at Arthur Road in a building that was previously an old people's home and started out with 18 beds. Since its opening, the clinic provided surgical and medical terminations for thousands of women each year. Nowadays it also provides sterilisation, and vasectomy services.
The establishment is the single largest abortion clinic in the UK with an annual caseload of around 10,000 clients. Approximately 85% of the caseload is on contract to the NHS. It is approved by the Secretary of State for Health under the Abortion Act 1967 and regulated by the Healthcare Commission and has to meet the national minimum standards set by the Care Standards Act 2000. The clinic is named after the Calthorpe family who owned much of the area in Edgbaston during its growth in the 19th century.

Sherwood Oaks

Sherwood Oaks is a middle class subdivision in the Spring Branch super neighborhood of Houston, Texas. The neighborhood is zoned to Stratford High School, Spring Forest Middle School, and Sherwood Elementary School, all schools run by the Spring Branch Independent School District. Sherwood Oaks has roughly 300 Houses.
The Sherwood Oaks subdivision was officially platted in 1961 with construction continuing through the early 1970s. The total number of homes is 342. The neighborhood is filled with very mature trees, and many of the streets end in cul-de-sacs. Because the neighborhood only has three main entry points, cut through traffic is minimal. The Oak Stream entrance at the I-10 access road is the subdivisions main entrance, with Timberline Drive at Sherwood Forest and Hazelhurst at Sherwood Forest being alternate entrances.
As of March 2010, home values hoover at around $230,000. The subdivision has become increasingly popular because it is zoned to Stratford High School and because the homes resemble those of the more expensive West Memorial homes that sell from about $400,000. The houses along Scenic Ridge Drive back onto the Addicks Reservoir, a large green space area. The neighborhood has a very active homeowners association, private garbage, and regular security provided by off-duty Harris County constables.

Louisa Garrett Anderson

Dr. Louisa Garrett Anderson, CBE (28 July 1873 – 15 November 1943) was a medical pioneer, a member of the Women's Social and Political Union, a suffragette, and social reformer. She was the daughter of the founding medical pioneer Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. Her aunt, Dame Millicent Fawcett was a British suffragist. Anderson was the Chief Surgeon of the Women's Hospital Corps (WHC) and a Fellow of Royal Society of Medicine
She was one of the three children of James George Skelton Anderson of the Orient Steamship Company co-owned by his uncle Arthur Anderson, and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson who was the first woman to qualify as a doctor, co-founder of the London School of Medicine for Women and Britain's first elected woman Mayor (of Aldeburgh).
She was educated at St Leonards School in St. Andrews, Fife and at the London School of Medicine for Women located at the Royal Free Hospital, where she worked as a doctor in private practice and hospitals.

Gregorian Consortium

The Gregorian Consortium is a collaborative association of three pontifical universities/institutes in Rome. In 1930 the motu proprio "Quod maxime" of Pope Pius XI associated the Pontifical Gregorian University (Greg), the Pontifical Biblical Institute (Biblicum), and the Pontifical Oriental Institute (Orientale) into a university consortium. All three institutions belong to the Holy See and are entrusted to the Society of Jesus.
The Gregorian has departments of philosophy and theology, offering degrees at the bachelor, licentiate, and doctorate levels. Its international faculty serves around 3800 students from over 150 countries. Among its notable alumni are seventeen popes, including eight of the last eleven.
The "Biblicum" offers degrees only at the licentiate (STL) and doctorate (SSD) levels. Courses deal with the Bible and its ancillary studies.
The "Orientale" offers a host of services to those researching Eastern Christianity. Approximately two-thirds of its students are enrolled in the Faculty of Eastern Church Studies, with its departments of theology and patristics, liturgy, and history. Degrees offered are only at the graduate level, the licentiate (SEOL) and doctorate (SEOD). About a third of the students pursue a degree in Eastern Canon Law where, again, only graduate degrees are offered, the licentiate (ICOL) and doctorate (ICOD).

The Czechoslovak government-in-exile officially restored Junák and Czech and Slovak Scout groups were founded in exile, especially in the North of England and the South of Scotland, Rover Crews were founded in the Czechoslovak Armed Units in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
In 1948 Scouting was banned again in Czechoslovakia. Czech and Slovak refugees founded again Czech and Slovak Scout groups in exile. Junák-in-Exile was formed as a National Scout Organisation-in-Exile for Czechoslovak Scouting. From 1948 to 1950 they were members of the Displaced Persons Scout Division of the Boy Scouts International Bureau.
After the end of Prague Spring in 1968 thousands of refugees left their homeland and many Scouts were among them. So the existing Junák units in many countries were enlarged and new Scout groups were founded in many countries. The Czech and Slovak Scouts-in-Exile in Switzerland founded in cooperation with the Scouts of Switzerland new Junák units. Junák was also active in countries such as Austria, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
After the Rebirth of Scouting in Czechoslovakia the Exile movement were disbanded and its members became members of Junák or of the N.S.O.s of their countries of residence.
The Emblem showed on the left is the badge of Czech and Slovak Scouting Abroad, before 1989 this Emblem was in use with the text: Czech and Slovak Scouting Exile.
In addition, there are Girl Scouts of the USA Overseas in Bratislava, serviced by way of USAGSO headquarters in New York

Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard

Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard is a fictional character, a robot supervillain in the DC Universe. The character first appears in "The Battle For Blüdhaven" #1 (May 2006), and becomes the main villain of the "Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters" limited series (October 2006). It was created by Jimmy Palmiotti, Justin Gray, and Daniel Acuña.
Mr. Gray has asserted that the character concept for Gonzo was derived from a character proposal by Grant Morrison, which was to have been an update of Bozo the Iron Man, but the final concept became very different from the inspiration.
Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard was created by the Mathemagicians of the Anti-Life Equation to spread chaos throughout Earth. In the aftermath of the chaos caused by Chemo being dropped onto the city of Blüdhaven, Gonzo managed to slip through a dimensional crack between this universe and the anti-matter universe. Father Time, the commanding officer of S.H.A.D.E., discovered him and started educating him, exposing to every piece of information known to man.
Under Time's orders, he becomes an exact duplicate of Senator Henry Knight, and kills the original, taking his place as President of the United States.
Gonzo betrays Father Time, forcing him to team up with Uncle Sam, providing the Freedom Fighters with the footage they need to unmask him.
Father Time turns Gonzo into data (using Atomic Knight technology) and traps him in an "orphan box" in the shape of a pair of glasses, hoping to use him against his creators, the Shadow Demons.
Gonzo is a cyborg, part-machine and part-organic, possessed of superhuman strength. His capacity to scan and absorb knowledge is nearly unlimited. He also possesses the ability to become a physical doppelganger of any human.

Trickle ring

A trickle ring is a circular drip irrigation device which evenly distributes water around the base of a tree or shrub. Connected to a water supply by a garden hose or tubing adapter fitting, trickle rings may be integrated into an irrigation network which waters many plants at the same time. By regulating the flow of water through the trickle ring, soil can be saturated at a rate which conserves water by minimizing wasteful surface runoff and losses due to evaporation.

Power bulge

A power bulge is a raised part (a bulge) of the hood of a car. The reason for a power bulge is to fit for instance a large engine or air filters that otherwise would not fit. Sometimes a power bulge is used to be able to fit a larger engine into a car that originally was not designed for it or it may be a design choice to be able to get a lower profile. As a power bulge is associated with performance cars it may also be used as a design element to give the impression of a fast car.

Patriarch Kirill of Moscow

Kirill or Cyril (, secular name Vladimir Mikhailovich Gundyayev, ; born 20 November 1946) is a Russian Orthodox bishop. He became Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus' and Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church on 1 February 2009.
Prior to becoming Patriarch, Kirill was Archbishop (later Metropolitan) of Smolensk and Kaliningrad beginning on 26 December 1984, and also Chairman of the Russian Orthodox Church's Department for External Church Relations and a permanent member of the Holy Synod beginning in 1989.
Kirill was born Vladimir Mikhailovich Gundyayev in Leningrad (present-day Saint Petersburg) on 20 November 1946. His father, Rev. Mikhail Gundyaev, died in 1974. His mother, Raisa Gundyaeva, a teacher of German, died in 1984. His elder brother, Archpriest Nikolay Gundyaev, is a professor at Leningrad Theological Academy and rector of the Holy Transfiguration Cathedral in St. Petersburg. His grandfather, Rev. Vasily Gundyaev, a Solovki prisoner, was imprisoned and exiled in the '20s, '30s and '40s for his church activity and struggle against Renovationism.
After finishing the eighth grade, Vladimir Gundyaev got a job in the Leningrad Geological Expedition and worked for it from 1962 to 1965 as cartographer, combining work with studies at secondary school. After graduation from school, he entered the Leningrad Seminary and later the Leningrad Theological Academy, from which he graduated cum laude in 1970.
On 3 April 1969, Metropolitan Nicodemus (Rotov) of Leningrad and Novgorod tonsured him with the name of Kirill after saint Cyril the Philosopher and on 7 April ordained him as hierodeacon and on 1 June as hieromonk.
From 1970 to 1971 Father Kirill taught Dogmatic Theology and acted as rector's assistant for students’ affairs at the Leningrad Theological Schools and at the same time worked as personal secretary to Metropolitan Nicodem and supervising instructor of the first-grade seminarians.
On 12 September 1971, Kirill was elevated to the rank of archimandrite and was posted as a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church to the World Council of Churches (WCC) in Geneva. On 26 December 1974, he was appointed rector of the Leningrad Academy and Seminary. Since December 1975, he has been a member of the WCC Central Committee and Executive Committee.
In 1971 he was appointed representative of the Moscow Patriarchate at the World Council of Churches and has been actively involved in the ecumenical activity of the Russian Orthodox Church since then.
"The Supreme Authority of the Church charged Kirill with the following functions:"
Since 1994 Kirill has hosted a weekly Orthodox television program "Слово пастыря" on ORT/Channel One.
On 6 December 2008, the day after the death of Patriarch Alexy II, the Russian Holy Synod elected him locum tenens of the Patriarchal throne. On 9 December, during the funeral service for Alexey II in Christ the Saviour Cathedral (which was broadcast live by Russia's state TV channels), he was seen and reported to have fainted at one point. On 29 December, when talking to journalists, he said he was opposed to any reforms of a liturgical or doctrinal nature in the Church. On 27 January 2009, the ROC Local Council (the 2009 Pomestny Sobor) elected Kirill I of Moscow as Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus; with 508 votes out of 700.) He was enthroned on 1 February 2009.
The conservative wing in the Russian Orthodox Church criticized Kirill for practicing ecumenism throughout the 1990s. In 2008, breakaway Bishop Diomid of Anadyr and Chukotka criticized him for associating himself with the Catholic Church. However, in a recent statement, Kirill stated that there could be no doctrinal compromise with the Catholic Church, and that discussions with them did not have the goal of seeking unification.
Still, contact with Benedict XVI was characterized as greatly warm and with mutual respect with relations between the churches following. In 2012, Kirill's visit to Poland advanced greatly relations with the Roman Catholic hierarchy of Poland. Visits and encounters with Roman Catholics in Russia and abroad continue to enjoy support, if tacit, from many Orthodox clergy and lay people.
On 12 February 2016, Kirill and Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, met at José Martí International Airport near Havana, Cuba, and signed a thirty point joint declaration, prepared in advance, addressing global issues including their hope for re–establishment of full unity, the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, the Syrian Civil War and church organisation in Ukraine. This was the first meeting between a pope and a Russian Orthodox patriarch.
Patriarch Kirill introduced significant changes in the administrative structure of the Church: On 27 July 2011 the Holy Synod of the Church established the Central Asian Metropolitan District, reorganizing the structure of the Church in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. In addition on 6 October 2011, at the request of the Patriarch, the Holy Synod introduced the metropoly (, mitropoliya), administrative structure bringing together neighboring eparchies.
On 20 October 2008, while on a tour of Latin America, he had a meeting with First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Fidel Castro. Castro commended Metropolitan Kirill as his ally in combating "American imperialism". Kirill awarded Fidel and Raúl Castro the Order of St. Daniel of Moscow on behalf of Patriarch Alexy II in recognition of their decision to build the first Russian Orthodox Church in Havana, to serve the Russian expatriates living there.
He was criticised by some for the ROC's failures in the Diocese of Sourozh and Ukraine.
Kirill "heartily congratulated" Alexander Lukashenko for winning the Belarusian presidency in 2010 by an apparent 80% majority, in elections marred by violence and accusations of intimidation and vote rigging.
When Kirill was elected Patriarch on 27 January 2009, by the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church by secret vote he gained 508 out of 702 votes and enthroned during liturgy at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Moscow on 1 February 2009 the service was attended, among others, by President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and prime minister Vladimir Putin.
The following day, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev hosted a reception (a formal banquet) for the ROC bishops in the Grand Kremlin Palace, whereat Patriarch Kirill held forth about the Byzantine concept of symphonia as his vision of the ideal of church-state relations, though acknowledging that it was not possible to fully attain to it in Russia today.
On 8 February 2012 at a meeting of religious leaders in Moscow, Kirill described the Putin era as "a miracle of God" and criticised his opponents. He said that those who were demonstrating for democratic reform and the rule of law were emitting "ear piercing shrieks"
Journalists of the newspapers "Kommersant" and "Moskovskij Komsomolets" accused Kirill of profiteering and abuse of the privilege of duty-free importation of cigarettes granted to the Church in the mid-1990s and dubbed him "Tobacco Metropolitan". The Department for External Church Relations was alleged to have acted as the largest supplier of foreign cigarettes in Russia. The profits of this operation allegedly under Kirill's direction were estimated to have totaled $1.5 billion by sociologist Nikolai Mitrokhin in 2004, and at $4 billion by "The Moscow News" in 2006. However, Nathaniel Davis noted that "...There is no evidence that Metropolitan Kirill has actually embezzled funds. What is more likely is that profits from the importation of tobacco and cigarettes have been used for urgent, pressing Church expenses." The duty-free importation of cigarettes ended in 1997. In his 2002 interview with "Izvestia", Metropolitan Kirill called the allegations about his profiteering a political campaign against him.
Alexander Pochinok who was the minister of taxes and levies (1999-2000), claimed in 2009 that Kirill had no involvement in the violations.
Three female members of the feminist group Pussy Riot were arrested in March 2012 for performing a brief song in the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow during which they called on the Virgin Mary to "chase Putin out". The women were arrested for hooliganism and were later sentenced to two years. Commenting on the case, Kirill said they were "doing the work of Satan" and should be punished. This sparked criticism of the Orthodox Church on the Runet for not showing mercy, while Amnesty International described the women as "prisoners of conscience". In their closing statements, members of Pussy Riot claimed that Patriarch Kirill had used the church to support the cultural position of Putin's government.
Pope Benedict XVI, who was the leader of the Catholic Church at the time, has supported the position of the Russian Orthodox Church on this issue.
In March 2012, the former Russian Health Minister (1999–2004) Yury Shevchenko, pursuant to a court ruling, paid about 20 million rubles ($676,000) in compensation for the dust resultant from the renovation work that had settled in a flat upstairs in the prestigious House on the Embankment privately owned by Patriarch Kirill and occupied by the Patriarch's long-time friend businesswoman (variously described as Kirill's "sister", "second cousin", or "wife") Lidia Leonova. According to the media reports, the former minister is personally acquainted with the then RF prime-minister Vladimir Putin.
"I sold my apartment in St. Petersburg, and we paid the required sum", said Shevchenko's son, also Yury, in early April 2012.
According to the lawsuit, renovation works in Shevchenko's apartment stirred up a lot of dust, which settled on a collection of valuable books owned by Kirill. The Patriarch confirmed his ownership of the dusty apartment in a private conversation with journalist Vladimir Solovyov.
Most of the reports in the media tended to be critical of Patriarch Kirill and laughing at the claims that the dust was harmful, pointing out that it was just sand and it would have been far more efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up. The Patriarch himself then said he thought it to be inappropriate to forgive Shevchenko.
When accused of wearing a Swiss Breguet watch worth over £20,000, Kirill denied having worn it, saying that any photographs showing him wearing it must be fakes. However, photographs on his official website showed it on his wrist and one even showed it airbrushed out, but with a reflection of it still visible on a table surface. Kirill responded by saying that "the guilty ones [for the image manipulation] will be punished severely". A spokesperson added that it was "unethical" to discuss Kirill's private life, and the Russian Orthodox Church said on 4 April 2012 that foreign forces were taking revenge on it for supporting Putin: "The attacks have become more prominent during the pre-election and post-election period [... This] shows their political and also anti-Russian motives." In June 2012, Kirill was given the (given in Russia each year "for the most dubious achievements in show business") for "immaculate disappearance of a watch" in the category "Miracles up to the elbows". The award found a pained reaction from representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church.
In a sermon on Sunday 20 March 2016, the Sunday of Orthodoxy, Kirill decried some (unspecified) Human Rights and said that "Orthodoxy must defend itself" and fight against the "heresy" of (unspecified) human rights, which "contradicted the Bible".

Sergei Pugachev

Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev, also spelled Sergey Pugachyov, (; born 4 February 1963 in Kostroma, USSR) is a businessman, public figure, and politician. A billionaire, Pugachev was a major influence on Russian politics, helping to get both Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin elected President of Russia. In 2001, he became a senator, a position he served for ten years.
Pugachev holds a PhD in Engineering Sciences, and is a member of the Russian Academy of Engineering, and honoured worker of the Republic of Tuva.
With perestroika came greater opportunities for private enterprise. By the time of the collapse of the USSR, Pugachev had already established a career as an independent businessman with international investments in projects in the European Union, USA, and Russia. These projects were primarily in finance, development, infrastructure construction, mechanical engineering, shipbuilding, media, and biotechnology.
In 1990, Pugachev and some of his associates created Severny Torgovy Bank (Northern Trading Bank or NTB). In 1991, Pugachev moved to Moscow and opened an NTB branch. However, his business partners wished to continue to focus on St Petersburg, and so he separated from NTB. In 1992 he withdrew his capital from NTB and had no further involvement with the bank.
In 1992 Pugachev created International Industrial Bank (the Bank, also sometimes referred to as Mezhprombank or IIB). However, in 2001, he again, moved on to other investments, severing all ties with the bank. In 2001, Pugachev acquired a controlling stake in the Russian television channel 'Channel Three'.
In 2004 Pugachev established Obyedinennaya Promyshlennaya Korporaciya (OPK), one of Russia's largest diversified corporations, managing assets worth more than 300 billion roubles.
Among the shipbuilding assets of the OPK are some of the largest enterprises in the industry - shipyards Severnaya Verf, Baltyisky Zavod and Design Bureau Iceberg.
During the years in which they were in operation, the shipyards handed over warships and civilian vessels to a total value of $3.2 billion.
The largest energy asset of the OPK was Yeniseiskaya Promyshlennaya Kompaniya (EPC), which lead the development of Elegest, one of the world's largest coking coal deposits.
In 2004, Pugachev signed an agreement with the Office of Presidential Affairs to redevelop the Middle Trading Rows on the Red Square in Moscow.
After arriving in Moscow, Pugachev became increasingly involved in politics. During the 90’s Pugachev was the advisor to the Head of the Presidential Administration, in 1996 he became one of the leading forces behind the election campaign of presidential candidate Boris Yeltsin. After his successful election In July 1996, Pugachev was honored with the Letter of Gratitude from the President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin "For great contribution to the development of Russian democracy and participation in the preparation and execution of the national elections campaign."
In 1998 he was a member of the Russian delegation to Washington headed by the Minister of Finance Mikhail Zadornov, for talks on the support of Russia by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank following the August default.
During 1999 – 2000 Pugachev was one of the key players during the election campaign of Vladimir Putin, and subsequently, took on the role of economic advisor to the President’s administration.
At the beginning of 2000, President Putin oversaw a raft of economic reforms aimed at stimulating the economy and entrenching the free market. Pugachev, who increasingly saw his role as being at the junction of Russian politics and economics, felt that he could contribute to his country’s future in other ways than through business. As a member of the board of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, he was part of an organisation whose main activity was initiating new draft bills and improving existing legislation in relation to economic and financial matters.
From November 2000 to January 2003 he was the Vice-President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
On 24 December 2001, Pugachev was elected as an independent member of the Federal Council (the upper house of the Russian Federation) of the Government of the Republic of Tuva in southern Siberia (his candidacy was supported by approximately 80% of Tuvan deputies).
Pugachev's primary duty as a senator was to work on preparing drafts of new laws for implementation. He, together with the help of his 10-strong staff, worked on a number of projects including the anti-corruption law (which was ultimately adopted by the Russian Parliament). He also worked actively to promote the interests of the Tuva region. During his time as a senator, Pugachev personally oversaw several development projects in the Tuva region and made charitable donations to projects in the region, including towards a new museum and the restoration of a number of community churches. In this role Pugachev served 10 years - until 2011.
In addition to his duties as a senator, Pugachev was a member of several parliamentary committees, including the Committee on Federal Affairs and Regional Policies. He was also an adviser to the Head of the President’s administration.
Pugachev became a French ciitzen in 2009. By 2011, Pugachev was under investigation by the Russian government for embezzling loans from the government to Mezhprombank. Pugachev argued the charges were politically motivated and left Russia to live in London, where he has a house with his partner and children.
Despite living in the UK, Pugachev was not free from his legal battles, as the Russian government used the London courts to target him. Most of his $15 billion fortune was frozen in 2014, under a worldwide freezing order issued by the Chancery Court and upheld by the Court of Appeal. In June 2015, despite a court order to stay in Britain, Pugachev fled the country and turned up in Nice, France. In September 2015
Pugachev is in civil partnership with Alexandra Tolstoy-Miloslavsky. They have two young sons and daughter.
Pugachev also has two grown-up sons from his first marriage - Victor and Alexander.

Travis Sentell

Rusty "Travis" Tourneur Sentell, Jr. is a character from the now-cancelled American soap opera "Search for Tomorrow". He was played by actor Rod Arrants.
Travis was the son of Rusty Sentell, Senior (David Gale), and his wife, Mignon (Anita Keal). He was a wealthy businessman who brought his family's corporation, Tourneur Instruments, into the fictional community of Henderson.
He was immediately smitten by Liza Kaslo, who had just lost her husband, Steve, to leukemia. After her mother, Janet, refused to bankroll Steve's rock opera on the advice of her legal team, Travis offered to do so. He and Liza eventually fell in love and experienced dangerous adventures. One escapade took place in Hong Kong, where Travis gave Liza a jade necklace. Shady singer Zack Anders (Shawn Stevens) and his villainous manager, Sylvie Descartes (Maureen Anderman), were intent on stealing it but were thwarted. Liza and Travis then married, but his enemies were always around somewhere, and that meant their lives were constantly in danger. Travis also contended with his supposedly deceased father, who was furious that he was married to Liza and wanted Travis to marry his goddaughter, Aja Doyan (Susan Monts).
Travis and Liza also tried to adopt his cousin Lee's (Doug Stevenson) son, Roger Lee, but were thwarted by Lee's wife, waitress Cissie Mitchell Sentell (Patsy Pease). Eventually, they adopted another child, and Lee, Cissie, and their son left Henderson.
Travis eventually was killed mysteriously; the identity of the murderer was not certain. His uncle, Martin Tourneur, was married to, and then divorced from, Joanne Gardner. This connected Travis to two of the show's long-running characters (since Liza was Stu Bergman's granddaughter). The Travis and Liza story was an attempt by the long-running Search to try to emulate the success of the Luke and Laura story on "General Hospital", which was, at the time, highly successful.

Albert Risso

Albert J. Risso, GMH was a Gibraltarian trade unionist and politician. He was the first president of the Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights (AACR) in Gibraltar.
Albert Risso was one of the first political activists in the British territory of Gibraltar. at a very young age, he was one of the campaigners for the involvement of the Gibraltarian civilian population (and especially its working class) in governing the colony. In 1919, he was one of the members of a so-called "deputation of working men" who went to London to meet the Secretary of State for the Colonies and ask for the creation of a representative body that could succeed the Sanitary Commission, an unelected body whose members, usually belonging to the upper class, were nominated by the Governor. The campaign, driven by the trade unions, brought about the creation of the Gibraltar City Council in 1921.
By the start of World War II, Risso was a foreman mechanic and a City Council employee. When most of Gibraltar's civilian population was evacuated, Risso was one of the few Gibraltarians that remained on The Rock. In September 1942, a group of fellow Gibraltarians, clerks and workers, led by Risso came together to form the AACR, an association advocating the Gibraltarians' civil rights. Risso was president of the AACR from 1942 to 1948, when he was succeeded by former vicepresident, Joshua Hassan. In 1947, he was appointed president of the Gibraltar Confederation of Labour, a trade union created to represent the AACR's rank and file working class supporters.
Risso was continuously reelected member of the Gibraltar Legislative Council during the 1950s and early 1960s, as candidate of the AACR. He was elected in 1950, 1953, 1956, 1959 and 1964. Risso stood for election for all AACR candidatures to the City Council and to the Legislative Council first, and the House of Assembly until the 1970s. He was also a member of the Constitutional Conference which drafted the Gibraltar's first constitution.
In the 1980s, Risso was offered a decoration. However, he refused on the grounds of his egalitarian ideals.
In 2004, Risso was posthumously granted the Gibraltar Award by the Self Determination for Gibraltar Group for his contribution to Gibraltar as a civil rights activist and politician.
On 22 February 2005 the Government of Gibraltar announced that a proposed senior citizens building at Waterport in Gibraltar was to be named "Albert Risso House" following his enormous contribution to public life.
Upon the creation of the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour in 2008, Albert Risso was posthumously awarded the Medallion and therefore was recorded in the Gibraltar Roll of Honour.

In Stormy Nights

In Stormy Nights is the final studio album by the Japanese band Ghost. It was released by Drag City in 2007.
The CD and LP releases of the album have slightly different track listings. These are as follows:
The following people contributed to "In Stormy Nights:"
"In Stormy Nights" has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The album currently has a 76 out of 100 rating on the review aggregate site Metacritic, which indicates "generally favorable reviews."
Reviewer Matthew Murphy of Pitchfork Media gave the album an 8.0/10, writing "And though "In Stormy Nights"... can hardly be said to be a perfect work, one has to admire and celebrate Ghost's determination never to step in the same river twice." In another positive review, Allmusic's Thom Jurek called the album "A work of absolute beauty, chaos, seductive darkness and cosmic light." Andrew Gaerig of Stylus Magazine gave the album a B+, writing that "In Stormy Nights" "is easily their most unhinged, aggressive record; they make a show of steamrolling their subtler instincts."
Not all reviews were positive, though. Both Dusted Reviews' Matthew Wuethrich and Almost Cool's Aaron Coleman criticized the track "Hemicyclic Anthelion." Wuethrich called the track "bloated and forced," while Coleman wrote that the track "just completely derails what would otherwise be a fairly solid and concise album." In another negative review, Slant Magazine's Jimmy Newlin criticized "In Stormy Nights" for its lack of warmth, writing "Maybe pastiche is inevitable, even in the Japanese avant garde scene, but can't it at least be a little more fun?"

Tomb of Samuel

The Tomb of Samuel , translit. "Kever Shmuel ha-Nevi";), (, translit. "an-Nabi Samu'il" or "Nebi Samwil", is the traditional burial site of the biblical Hebrew prophet Samuel, atop a steep hill at an elevation of 908 meters above sea level. It is situated in the Palestinian village of Nabi Samwil in the West Bank, 1.3 kilometers north of the Jerusalem neighborhood of Ramot. On the site is a building containing a mosque built in the 18th century that was formerly a church. The tomb itself is located in an underground chamber where a small synagogue is located. The Israeli Ministry of Tourism website states "Over time practically every ancient Jewish traveler mentioned the place and its synagogue."
Yitzhak Magen conducted archaeological excavations from 1992-2003. On the southeastern slope is a urban settlement dating back to the 8th-7th centuries BCE, and remnants that Magen believed to be the Mizpah in Benjamin of the Book of Samuel. By contrast, Jeffrey Zorn concluded that there are no remains at the site, from the period in which the Samuel narratives are set, and it could therefore not be Mizpah. Magen's own conclusions have been criticised for stretching the evidence beyond the obvious implications, which he himself hints at:
However, if Mizpah in Benjamin was Tell en-Nasbeh on the Nablus Road, Ishmael who had assassinated Gedaliah would not have fled to Ammon via Gibeon which is located to the west near Nabi Samwil which overlooks Jerusalem. Furthermore, Judas Machabeus, preparing for war with the Syrians, gathered his men "to Maspha, over against Jerusalem: for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel".
A large monastery was built by the Byzantines, of which little remains. There is no clear evidence that the place was considered the Tomb of Samuel, or indeed a place of religious significance, before Byzantine times. Magen argues that the builders of the monastery did not believe they were building over the tomb of Samuel, instead regarding their construction only as a memorial. The fifth century writer Jerome, for example, argues that Samuel's remains were moved to Chalcedon, on the orders of Emperor Arcadius; this would be a century before the Byzantine monastery was built.
A sixth-century Christian author identified the site as Samuel's burial place. According to the Bible, however, the prophet is buried at his hometown, Ramah, to the east of the hill which is located near Geba. The 12th-century Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela visited the site when he traveled the land in 1173, writing that the Crusaders had found the bones of Samuel in a Jewish cemetery in Ramla on the coastal plain and reburied here, overlooking the Holy City. He wrote that a church dedicated to St. Samuel of Shiloh had been built on the hill. This may refer to the abbey church of St. Samuel built by Premonstratensian canons and inhabited from 1141 to 1244.
Raymond of Aguilers, who wrote a chronicle of the First Crusade (1096–1099), relates that on the morning of June 7, 1099, the Crusaders reached the summit of Nebi Samuel, and when they saw the city of Jerusalem, which they had not yet seen, they fell to the ground and wept in joy; the Crusaders named the place "Mount of Joy" (Latin "Mons Gaudi", French "Mont de Joie"), for this reason. The Crusaders built a fortress on the spot, which was razed by the Mamelukes.
Some identify the location with the Biblical temple of Gibeon, though consensus among experts places it at the village of al Jib.
Jews had begun efforts to found a village at the site in 1890, originally called "Ramah" after the biblical home of Samuel, and then referred to by the name of the group which had purchased the lands, "Nahalat Yisrael". Over the next five years various attempts to actualise the plan had failed due to bureaucratic obstacles, but in 1895, 13 Yemenite Jewish families joined the group and succeeded in the endeavour, even engaging in agriculture there.
Nebi Samuel's strategic location made it the site of battles during the British conquest of Ottoman Palestine in 1917, and the village was badly damaged from artillery fire and abandoned. It was resettled in 1921, but various difficulties lead it to again disband after a number of years. The mosque built in 1730 was damaged in the battle between the British and the Turks in 1917. It was restored in World War I.
The location was again significant in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and the 1967 Six-Day War, and was used by artillery of the Jordanian Arab Legion to bombard Jerusalem, in addition to being a base for attacks on Jewish traffic during the 1948 siege of Jerusalem.
Nebi Samuel and the surrounding archeological excavations are now part of a national park. An Arab village of 20 families is located on the hilltop.
Both Jewish and Muslim prayers are held at the tomb. Many religious Jews visit the tomb on the 28th of Iyar, the anniversary of Samuel the Prophet's death.

Arlene Sierra

Arlene Sierra (born June 1, 1970, in Miami) is an American composer of contemporary classical music, working in London, United Kingdom.
She studied at Oberlin College Conservatory of Music, Yale University School of Music and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, receiving a DMA in 1999; her principal teachers were Martin Bresnick, Michael Daugherty and Jacob Druckman. A composition fellow at the Britten-Pears School (Aldeburgh Festival) in 2000 and Tanglewood in 2001, teachers included Louis Andriessen, Oliver Knussen, Magnus Lindberg, and Colin Matthews. She also worked with Judith Weir at the Dartington International Summer School in 1999, Paul Heinz Dittrich in Berlin in 1997-8, and Betsy Jolas and Dominique Troncin at The American Conservatory of Fontainebleau Schools in 1993.
Her music has been commissioned by organizations including the Seattle Symphony, Tanglewood Music Festival, the New York Philharmonic, the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, the Albany Symphony, the Cheltenham International Festival, the Jerome, PRS and Cheswatyr Foundations, and the Ralph Vaughan Williams Trust. Performers of her work have included New York City Opera VOX, the American Composers Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta, the New Music Players, Psappha, the International Contemporary Ensemble, Chroma, the Schubert Ensemble, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, and the Tokyo Philharmonic. In 2001, she was the first woman to win the Takemitsu Prize; in 2007 she received a Charles Ives Fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters with a citation for music, "by turns, urgent, poetic, evocative and witty." In 2011, a debut CD of chamber music was released by Bridge Records: Arlene Sierra, Volume 1 and she was named Composer of the Year by the Classical Recording Foundation. A second CD, Game of Attrition: Arlene Sierra, Vol. 2, was released in 2014 including four orchestral works recorded by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Jac Van Steen, conductor. Her work "Moler" from the same disc was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2014.
Sierra was a Composition Tutor at Cambridge University in 2003-4 before joining Cardiff University School of Music as Lecturer in Composition in 2004. She was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2010 and awarded a University Research Leave Fellowship for 2015-16. Sierra is married to British composer Kenneth Hesketh.
Her music is published exclusively by Cecilian Music (ASCAP).
Arlene Sierra's compositions are rooted in early training in classical piano with Dr Rosalina Sackstein (a student of Claudio Arrau) and in electronic music at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, as well as her interests in dance and orchestral sonority and timbre. Many of Sierra's mature works have their origins in military strategy and game theory, with literary sources including Vitruvius and Sun Tzu, notably: "Ballistae" (2000) for large ensemble, "Truel" (2002-4) for piano trio, "A Conflict of Opposites" (2005) for violin or clarinet with piano, "Surrounded Ground" (2008) for sextet, and "Art of War" (2010), a concerto for piano and orchestra.
Sierra is also inspired by bird song, insect calls and sounds and processes from the natural world. Her 2009 work, "Game of Attrition" – commissioned by the New York Philharmonic – takes its structure from processes described by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species. Other works that employ natural sounds and processes include "Cicada Shell" (2006) for ensemble, "Birds and Insects, Books 1 and 2" (2007, 2015) for piano solo, "Insects in Amber" (2010) for string quartet, "Butterflies Remember a Mountain" (2013) for piano trio, and "Urban Birds" (2014) for three pianos with percussion and electronics.
Sierra has also demonstrated an interest in dramatic and stage works centered on women protagonists, in scenarios ranging from Faust in the opera "Faustine" to human trafficking in the collaborative chamber opera "Cuatro Corridos". Since 2012, she has been working on a series of new scores to films by Maya Deren, including "Meditation on Violence" and "Ritual in Transfigured Time".

Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation

The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation is a United Kingdom-based charity (registered no. 299955) established in 1988 to support closer links between Britain and Japan. It was founded with a benefaction from Daiwa Securities Co Ltd (now known as Daiwa Capital Markets, the investment banking arm of Japan's second largest brokerage Daiwa Securities Group).
The Foundation carries out its objective through the following activities:
The Foundation is based at Daiwa Foundation Japan House, a Georgian town house designed by Decimus Burton overlooking Regent's Park in central London. Daiwa Foundation Japan House acts as a centre for UK-Japan relations in Britain by offering a programme of seminars, exhibitions and book launches as well as meeting rooms for Japan-related activities and facilities for visiting academics.
Part of Daiwa Foundation Japan House, 13 Cornwall Terrace, was the home of Sir Arthur Lasenby Liberty (1843–1917), founder of Liberty & Co..
The Foundation is represented in Japan by its Tokyo Office, which provides local assistance to Daiwa Scholars and administers grant applications from Japan. It also handles general enquiries about the Foundation's programmes.
The Daiwa Scholarship is an educational programme that sends British graduates to Japan for 19 months. Daiwa Scholars spend 1 month studying Japanese language in the UK, 12 months studying Japanese language in Japan, 1 month on a homestay and 6 months on a work placement. Up to 6 Daiwa Scholarships are available each year.
The programme was established in 1991 and was inspired by the belief that the exchange of young people would foster mutual understanding and support the long-term relationship between Britain and Japan.
It is a core programme of the Foundation and through it the Foundation seeks to identify future leaders in their fields who will derive personal and professional benefit from obtaining an in-depth experience of Japan.
Since 1991, 159 graduates from over 50 universities and over 60 different subject areas have completed the programme.
The Daiwa Scholarships in Japanese Studies is a programme established in April 2015 to fund postgraduate students of Japanese Studies on courses in either Japan or the UK. Applicants must be British citizens who are holders of a degree in Japanese Studies, defined as a course focusing primarily on the study of Japan and containing a substantial Japanese language component, and who are enrolled or enrolling in a Japanese Studies-related course in either Japan or the UK.
The Foundation provides funding through the following programmes:
Daiwa Foundation Small Grants are available from £2,000-£7,000 to individuals, societies, associations or other bodies in the UK or Japan to promote and support interaction between the two countries. They can cover all fields of activity, including educational and grassroots exchanges, research travel, the organisation of conferences, exhibitions, and other projects and events that fulfil this broad objective. New initiatives are especially encouraged.
Daiwa Foundation Awards are available from £7,000-£15,000 for collaborative projects that enable British and Japanese partners to work together, preferably within the context of an institutional relationship. Projects in academic, scientific, professional, cultural and educational fields are eligible.
Every three years, the Foundation makes prizes available in recognition of significant scientific collaboration between Japanese and British research teams.
The Daiwa Foundation Art Prize is a triennial prize open to British artists resident in the UK who have not previously had a solo exhibition in Japan. In addition to an exhibition in Japan, the winning artist will be given a period of support and introductions to key individuals and organisations in the Japanese contemporary art world. The winning artist is also awarded a participation fee of £5000.
The Foundation has an ongoing programme of UK-Japan events based mainly at Daiwa Foundation Japan House in London.
The Foundation organises an annual series of evening seminars based on a broad contemporary theme. Seminars draw on the experience and expertise of British and Japanese contributors to explore topics of mutual relevance and to stimulate debate amongst decision-makers.
Themes have included:
The gallery at Daiwa Foundation Japan House displays works by Japanese artists or British artists influenced by Japan. All exhibitions are free of charge.
The book launch series brings together experts to discuss new publications in the field of Japanese studies.
Daiwa Foundation Japan House provides space for voluntary groups with connections to Japan. Users of the meeting rooms and other facilities have included Asia-Pacific Technology Network; British Association for Japanese Studies; The Japan Foundation Endowment Committee; Sakura-kai, Japanese language classes; Hosei University; The Japan Society Art Circle; International Children's Bunko Association; Japanese Women's Association; Urasenke Foundation; and flower arranging groups.

Young Folks

"Young Folks" is the first single from Peter Bjorn and John's third album, "Writer's Block" (released in 2006). The single features Victoria Bergsman as a guest vocalist.
The song first attracted notice on websites such as Myspace and YouTube, and was used in a number of European commercials and television shows. Since mid-2007, the song has earned extensive airplay on American radio, most notably on dance radio outlets like KNHC/Seattle, KNGY/San Francisco and Sirius Satellite's The Beat. It is notable for being a popular song with whistling (the whistling was originally added in as a placeholder for another instrument). The whistling and part of the song have a tune reminiscent of the "oriental riff".
The song was ranked #5 on Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Tracks of 2006 list. Pitchfork reviewed the song on 19 July 2006, giving it three out of five stars. The song was also voted #2 in the 2006 NME Track of the Year poll. Planet Sound named this their #2 single of 2006. The song was named the number one song of 2007 according to the iTunes Store. Y-Rock On XPN also named the song #1 of 2007. In October 2011, "NME" placed it at number 92 on its list 150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years. It was included in Spinner's 10 Best Whistling Parts in Songs. "Rolling Stone" put the song also on its list of the 15 Best Whistling Songs of All Time.
The single was re-released on 17 September 2007, when it reached number 13 in the UK, beating the original chart position of number 33 in 2006.
The video was directed by Ted Malmros with animation by Graham Samuels. It is featured in the video game "SingStar Pop 2", as well as in "Lips".
The video starts off with Peter and Victoria sitting in a park, on a bench. Peter teaches Victoria how to whistle. Then the video switches over to them both sitting in a bus where the song starts. Throughout the video, scenes of the band playing the song can be seen and eventually the video ends with a big party where everybody "seems to disappear".
The group performed the song on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien" on 29 January 2007, and on "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno on 18 May 2007, (the latter with "Tonight Show" band member Vicki Randle on bongos). On 29 September 2007, the band played "Young Folks", with Victoria Bergsman's vocals, on "Friday Night with Jonathan Ross" on BBC1. When the band performed the song at the 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Bergsman's vocals were performed by Bebban Stenborg of Shout Out Louds. On Peter Bjorn and John's 2008 Australian tour, Victoria Bergsman's vocals were performed by Tracyanne Campbell of Camera Obscura.

<doc id="9365953" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9365953" title="Droseridites">
Droseridites

Droseridites is a genus of extinct plants of possible droseracean or nepenthacean affinity. It is a form taxon known only from fossil pollen. Species assigned to this genus originate from numerous regions of the world, including Europe (from France to the Caucasus), India, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Kerguelen Islands.
This genus is characterised by inaperturate and spinose pollen grains that are united in loose tetrahedral tetrads (groups of four). The grains are prolate, striate, and tricolpate. The colpi are slender and long, whereas the striae are very fine, densely packed, and situated parallel to the polar axis.
"Droseridites spinosus", the type species, has been recorded from the Tertiary of the Kerguelen Islands and the Miocene of India, including the Warkalli Formation (Bharathi and Kundra Clay Mines, Kerala) and the Sindhudurg Formation (Mavli Mine at Redi, Sindhudurg District, Maharashtra). It is of possible nepenthacean affinity. Specimens identified in the literature as "D." cf. "spinosus" have also been reported from Hungarian Miocene deposits.
"Droseridites baculatus" was described from the Ghazalat-1 Well, Qattara Depression, Egypt.
"Droseridites echinosporus" has been recorded from European Tertiary strata and is a member of a group of similar species that have been interpreted as belonging to the genus "Nepenthes".
Sites for "D. major", a possible nepenthacean species, include the Tertiary of Europe and the Palaeocene-early Eocene Rekmangiri Coalfield of Garo Hills, Meghalaya, India.
"Droseridites parvus" was originally described from the lower Eocene Cherry Formation of Assam, India. It has also been recorded from the Palaeocene Tura Formation of the ""Retialetes emendatus" zone" in Assam and the Oligocene-Neogene Dharmsala and Siwalik (Dharmsala and Nurpur areas, Kangra District, Himachal Pradesh). The species is characterised by wart-like sculpturing and is "presently impossible to interpret".
Pollen matching the description of "D. senonicus" has been found in formations of the Arabian Peninsula dating to as early as the Middle Cretaceous to late Upper Cretaceous, and it has been suggested that this species may represent an early palm taxon.
Unidentified "Droseridites" palynomorphs have been recorded from numerous sites in India, including the Miocene Cuddalore Formation (Neyveli Lignitefield, Tamil Nadu), the Palaeocene Tura Formation (Langrin Coalfield, Khasi Hills, Meghalaya), the Palaeocene Seam No. 1 (Rekmangiri Coalfield, Garo Hills, Meghalaya), and the Oligocene-Neogene Dharmsala and Siwalik.
Pollen of a number of species originally described under the genus "Droseridites" has been tentatively assigned to "Nepenthes". In 1985, Wilfried Krutzsch transferred three species of the ""D. echinosporus" group", creating the new combinations "Nepenthes echinatus", "N. echinosporus", and "N. major". However, at more than 40 µm in diameter, the tetrads of "D. major" are larger than those of any known extant "Nepenthes", and within the lower range of extant "Drosera" tetrads. Pollen from the Kerguelen Islands originally described as "D. spinosus" has also been interpreted as belonging to "Nepenthes".
Some authors consider "D. major" and "D. parvus" as synonyms of Nepenthidites laitryngewensis of the Palaeocene Lakadong Sandstone in Laitryngew, Khasi Hills, Meghalaya, India.

Frank Kopel

Frank Kopel (28 March 1949 – 16 April 2014) was a Scottish footballer who played as a left back. Born in Falkirk, he had an 18-year professional football career, during which he played for Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Dundee United and Arbroath. He then went into coaching, becoming assistant manager at Arbroath and Forfar Athletic with a spell on the Dundee United coaching staff in between.
Kopel was born in Falkirk and was a Scottish schoolboy international before signing for Manchester United as a schoolboy in 1964. He turned professional in 1966 and made his debut as a substitute in a 2–2 draw at home to Burnley on 9 September 1967. He made his full debut – and his only other appearance for the 1967–68 season – on 28 October 1967, playing at right-back in a 3–1 defeat away to Nottingham Forest. Kopel made a further 10 appearances for Manchester United during the 1968–69 season, including his European debut against Anderlecht on 27 November 1968, but he spent most of the season as a back-up to the club's first-choice full-backs, Shay Brennan and Tony Dunne. He was sold to Blackburn Rovers for £25,000 in March 1969, nearly two months after his final appearance for United, a 1–1 draw with Watford in the FA Cup. Kopel had a poor record during his time at Manchester United; out of his 12 appearances, they only won two matches and lost five.
Kopel spent over two years at Blackburn but made little impact and was released in December 1971. He joined Dundee United in January 1972; the first signing made by the club's new manager Jim McLean. Kopel would remain at Tannadice for the next ten years, playing nearly 400 first team games, and picking up two League Cup and two Scottish Cup runners-up medals during his time with the Terrors. In 1982 he moved to Arbroath as player/coach, before retiring from playing in 1984. He returned to United to coach and his son, Scott, was an apprentice at Tannadice before making a career at Chesterfield, Brechin City and Forfar Athletic. Kopel has the honour of having a Dundee United Supporters Club named after him, Frank Kopel's Travelling Shindig. In 2011 he was inducted into Dundee United's official Hall of Fame.
Kopel married Amanda in 1969. He was diagnosed as suffering vascular dementia in 2008. He died at age 65 at his home in Kirriemuir on 16 April 2014. He is survived by his wife and their son, Scott.

Sophie Blanchard

Sophie Blanchard (25 March 1778 – 6 July 1819) was a French aeronaut and the wife of ballooning pioneer Jean-Pierre Blanchard. Blanchard was the first woman to work as a professional balloonist, and after her husband's death she continued ballooning, making more than 60 ascents. Known throughout Europe for her ballooning exploits, Blanchard entertained Napoleon Bonaparte, who promoted her to the role of "Aeronaut of the Official Festivals", replacing André-Jacques Garnerin. On the restoration of the monarchy in 1814 she performed for Louis XVIII, who named her "Official Aeronaut of the Restoration".
Ballooning was a risky business for the pioneers. Blanchard lost consciousness on a few occasions, endured freezing temperatures and almost drowned when her balloon crashed in a marsh. In 1819, she became the first woman to be killed in an aviation accident when, during an exhibition in the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, she launched fireworks that ignited the gas in her balloon. Her craft crashed on the roof of a house and she fell to her death. She is commonly referred to as Madame Blanchard and is also known by many combinations of her maiden and married names, including Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Sophie Armant and Madeleine-Sophie Armant Blanchard.
Sophie Blanchard was born Marie Madeleine-Sophie Armant to Protestant parents at Trois-Canons, near La Rochelle. Little is known of her life before her marriage to Jean-Pierre Blanchard, the world's first professional balloonist. The date of her marriage is unclear; sources quote dates as early as 1794 or 1797, but most state 1804, the year of her first ascent. Blanchard had abandoned his first wife, Victoire Lebrun, and their four children to travel round Europe pursuing his ballooning career, and she later died in poverty. Variously described as Blanchard's "small, ugly, nervous wife", "small with sharp bird-like features" and later as "small and beautiful", Sophie was more at home in the sky than on the ground, where her nervous disposition meant she was easily startled. She was terrified of loud noises and of riding in carriages, but was fearless in the air. She and her husband were in an accident on a joint flight in 1807 (her 11th ascent, possibly his 61st), in which they crashed and he sustained a head injury. The shock apparently left her mute for a while.
Sophie made her first ascent in a balloon with Blanchard in Marseilles on 27 December 1804. The couple faced bankruptcy as a result of Blanchard's poor business sense, and they believed a female balloonist was a novelty that might attract enough attention to solve their financial problems. She described the feeling as an "incomparable sensation" ("sensation incomparable"). Sophie made a second ascent with Blanchard and for her third ascent on 18 August 1805, she flew solo from the garden of the Cloister of the Jacobins in Toulouse.
She was not the first woman balloonist. On 20 May 1784, the Marchioness and Countess of Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas and a Miss de Lagarde had taken a trip on a tethered balloon in Paris. Neither was she the first woman to ascend in an untethered balloon: in Blanchard's time, Citoyenne Henri, who had made an ascent with André-Jacques Garnerin in 1798, was widely credited with that ballooning first, although the honour actually belonged to Elizabeth Thible. Thible, an opera singer, had made an ascent to entertain Gustav III of Sweden in Lyon on 4 June 1784, fourteen years before Citoyenne Henri. Blanchard was, however, the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first to adopt ballooning as a career.
In 1809, her husband died from injuries sustained when he fell from his balloon in the Hague after suffering a heart attack. After his death, Sophie continued to make ascents, specialising in night flights, often staying aloft all night.
Sophie conducted experiments with parachutes as her husband had, parachuting dogs from her balloon, and as part of her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes. Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the baskets of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.
The couple had still been in debt at the time of Blanchard's death, so to minimise her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled gas balloon (or "Charlière"), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she was small and light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.
She became a favourite of Napoleon, and he appointed her to replace André-Jacques Garnerin in 1804. Garnerin had disgraced himself by failing to control the balloon that he had sent up to mark Napoleon's coronation in Paris; the balloon eventually drifted as far as Rome, where it crashed into the Lago di Bracciano and became the subject of many jokes at Napoleon's expense. The title given to her by Napoleon is unclear: he certainly made her "Aeronaut of the Official Festivals" ("Aéronaute des Fêtes Officielles") with responsibility for organising ballooning displays at major events, but he may have also made her his Chief Air Minister of Ballooning, in which role she is reported to have drawn up plans for an aerial invasion of England.
She made ascents for Napoleon's entertainment on 24 June 1810 from the Champ de Mars in Paris and at the celebration mounted by the Imperial Guard for his marriage to Marie-Louise of Austria. On the birth of Napoleon's son, Blanchard took a balloon flight over Paris from the Champs de Mars and threw out leaflets proclaiming the birth. She performed at the official celebration of his baptism at the Château de Saint-Cloud on 23 June 1811, with a firework display launched from the balloon, and again at the "Féte de l'Emperor" in Milan on 15 August 1811. She made an ascent in bad weather over the Campo Marte in Naples to accompany the review of the troops by Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat, the King of Naples, in 1811. When Louis XVIII entered Paris on 4 May 1814 after being restored to the French throne, Blanchard ascended in her balloon from the Pont Neuf as part of the triumphal procession. Louis was so taken with her performance that he dubbed her "Official Aeronaut of the Restoration".
Known throughout Europe, Blanchard drew large crowds for her ascents. In Frankfurt she was apparently the cause of the poor reception of Carl Maria von Weber's opera "Silvana" on its opening night, 16 September 1810: the people of the city flocked to see her demonstration while only a few attended the opera's debut. She gave many displays in Italy. In 1811 she travelled from Rome to Naples, splitting the journey in half with a stop after 60 miles (97 km), and later ascended again from Rome to a height of 12,000 feet (3,660 m) where she claimed that she fell into a profound sleep for a while before landing at Tagliacozzo. In the same year she again lost consciousness after having to ascend to avoid being trapped in a hailstorm near Vincennes. She spent 14½ hours in the air as a result. Sophie crossed the Alps by balloon, and on a trip to Turin on 26 April 1812 the temperature dropped so low that she suffered a nose bleed and icicles formed on her hands and face. She almost died on 21 September 1817 when, on a flight from Nantes (her 53rd), she mistook a marshy field for a safe landing spot. The canopy of her balloon became caught in a tree which caused the chair to tip over; Blanchard, entangled in the rigging, was forced into the water of the marsh and would have drowned had not help arrived soon after her landing. Sympathising with Marie Thérèse de Lamourous who was attempting to run a shelter for "fallen women" ("La Miséricorde") in Bordeaux, she offered to donate the proceeds from one of her ascents to the venture. De Lamourous refused the offer on the grounds that she could not be the cause of another risking their life.
On 6 July 1819, while making an ascent to start a display over the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, her hydrogen-filled balloon caught fire and Blanchard, entangled in the surrounding net, fell to her death. She was reported to be unusually nervous before starting this ascent.
Blanchard had performed regularly at the Tivoli Gardens, making ascents twice a week when she was in Paris. She had been warned repeatedly of the danger of using fireworks in her exhibitions. This display was to be a particularly impressive one with many more pyrotechnics than usual, and it appears that the warnings had made an impression on her. Some spectators implored her not to make the ascent, but others, eager to see the show, urged her on. One report suggested that she finally made up her mind and stepped into her chair with the words "Allons, ce sera pour la dernière fois" ("Let's go, this will be for the last time").
At about 10:30 p.m. (accounts differ as to the exact time), Blanchard began her ascent, carrying a white flag and wearing a white dress and a white hat topped with ostrich plumes. The wind was blowing strongly, and it appears the balloon struggled to rise. By shedding ballast Blanchard managed to get some lift, but the balloon brushed through the trees as it ascended. Once she had cleared the treetops Blanchard began the display by waving her flag. The balloon was illuminated by baskets containing "Bengal fire", a slow-burning, coloured pyrotechnic.
A few moments after beginning the display, and while still ascending, the balloon was seen to be in flames. Some reports say that the balloon momentarily disappeared behind a cloud and that when it reappeared it was on fire—whatever the circumstances, the gas in the balloon was burning. Blanchard began to descend rapidly, but the balloon, caught in the wind, continued to move off from the pleasure gardens even as it went down. Some spectators thought these events were part of the show and applauded and shouted their approval. The balloon had not risen very high and, although the escaping gas was burning, the gas within the balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent the craft plummeting directly to the ground. By rapidly shedding ballast Blanchard was able to slow the descent. Most reports say she appeared to be calm during the descent, but she was said to be wringing her hands in despair as the craft approached the ground. Rumours later circulated that she had gripped the chair of her craft so tightly that "several arteries had snapt through the effort."
Just above the rooftops of the Rue de Provence the balloon's gas was exhausted, and the craft struck the roof of a house. It was thought likely that she would have survived had that been the end of the incident, but the ropes holding the chair to the body of the balloon may have burnt through, or the impact may have thrown her forwards, with the result that Blanchard, trapped in the netting of the balloon, pitched over the side of the roof into the street below. John Poole, an eyewitness, described her final moments:
Some reports credit her with crying out ""À moi"!" ("help", or literally, "to me"), as she struck the roof. Although the crowds rushed to her assistance and attempts were made to save her, she had either died instantly, from a broken neck, or at most ten minutes later.
The most likely cause of the accident seemed to be that the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.
Norwich Duff, who had witnessed Blanchard's ascent and the accident, recorded:
On hearing she had died, the proprietors of the Tivoli Gardens immediately announced that the admission fees would be donated for the support of her children, and some spectators stood at the gates appealing to the citizens of Paris for donations. The appeal raised 2,400 francs, but after the collection it was discovered that she had no surviving children, so the money was used instead to erect a memorial, topped with a representation of her balloon in flames, above her grave in Père Lachaise Cemetery. Her tombstone was engraved with the epitaph "victime de son art et de son intrépidité" ("victim of her art and intrepidity"). The remainder of the money, about 1,000 francs, was donated to the Lutheran "" which Blanchard had attended. Though not rich, at the time of her death she had cleared the debts left to her by her husband and was financially secure. Each of her ascents had cost her around 1,000 francs, not including the cost of maintenance of the balloon. In her will she left property worth between 1,000 and 50,000 francs to the daughter of some acquaintances. In total, she had made 67 balloon ascents.
The story of her death was recounted throughout Europe. Jules Verne mentioned her in "Five Weeks in a Balloon" and, in "The Gambler", Fyodor Dostoevsky likened the thrill of committing oneself in gambling to the sensation that Blanchard must have felt as she fell. For others, her death proved a cautionary tale, either as an example of a woman exceeding her station (as with Grenville Mellen, who said that it proved "a woman in a balloon is either out of her element or too high in it") or as the price of vanity for attempting such spectacular shows. Charles Dickens commented "The jug goes often to the well, but is pretty sure to get cracked at last". With the advent of powered flight, ballooning and Blanchard's story were relegated to the margins of aviation history. A novel inspired by Blanchard's story, Linda Donn's "The Little Balloonist", was published in 2006.
a. As Comte de Provence, Louis had earlier been a patron of balloon pioneer Pilâtre de Rozier, who had been the victim of the first fatal ballooning accident on 15 June 1785.
b. Most sources do not mention the number of the house but some say number 15 or number 16, and some claim the building was a hotel.

Harriet the Spy (film)

Harriet the Spy is a 1996 children's film adaptation of the 1964 novel of the same name by Louise Fitzhugh, and starring Michelle Trachtenberg (in her film debut) as the title character.
This film was directed by Bronwen Hughes (in her feature film directing debut), produced by Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies and Rastar. It was the first film that was produced under the Nickelodeon Movies banner, and the first of two film adaptations of the "Harriet the Spy" books. In theaters, the remake pilot episode of "Hey Arnold!" from 1996 was shown before the film and received a PG rating from the MPAA.
The film was shot in Fort Lauderdale and Miami, Florida, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Harriet M. Welsch (Michelle Trachtenberg) is an 11-year-old sixth grader and a young spy/writer who is best friends with Simon "Sport" Rocque (Gregory Smith) and Janie Gibbs (Vanessa Lee Chester). She lives a privileged life with her parents and her nanny, Katherine "Ole Golly" (Rosie O'Donnell), who's the only person who knows all the things that Harriet has been snooping on. Harriet and her friends are enemies with mainly A rich girl named Marion Hawthorne (Charlotte Sullivan). For a while, Harriet lives life very well with being a spy and having fun with Golly.
One night, being home alone with Harriet, Golly invites a friend, Mr. George Waldenstein, over. And after Golly accidentally burns their dinner, the three go out to dinner and a movie instead, where things turn into a disaster. Mrs. Welch fires Golly for letting Harriet stay out late, but then she realizes that she still needs her to look after Harriet and begs her to stay. Golly tells her, however, that she was planning to leave soon since she believes that Harriet is old enough to take care of herself, much to everyone's protests. Shortly before she leaves, Golly encourages Harriet to never give up on her love for observing people just because she'll no longer be with her, and promises her that she will be the first to buy her very own autographed copy of Harriet's first novel she sells in the future. After Harriet bids Golly goodbye, she becomes depressed and withdrawn. She even gets caught when investigating the home of Agatha K. Plummer (Eartha Kitt).
The next day, she plays with her friends at the park, and disaster strikes. Marion finds Harriet's private notebook and begins reading all of Harriet's vindictive comments on her friends out loud, such as how she suspects Janie "will grow up to be a nutcase", and mocking Sport's father for barely earning any money. Everyone finds that they're all cruel and hurtful, and even Sport and Janie turn their backs on Harriet. The kids then create a Spy-Catcher club and torment Harriet on her spy routes.
After running into a police officer, and then getting zeroes on her schoolwork, Harriet gets her notebook taken away by her parents. Her parents tell Harriet's teacher Miss Elson (Nancy Beatty) to search Harriet every day for notebooks, much to Harriet's embarrassment. One day, during art, Rachel Hennessey "accidentally" pours blue paint all over Harriet. The other students claim to help clean her up when they are really just smearing the paint around on her, and when Marion pours more paint on Harriet's hair, Harriet slaps her face with great force, leaving a blue hand print. As a result of this, Harriet does things to get back at everyone individually, then exposes to them that Marion's father left her because he never loved her. She then carries out some of her other plans, including cutting off a chunk of Laura's hair, messing up one of Janie's science experiments, which causes Janie's parents to punish her, and making a fake picture of Sport in a maid's outfit, severely humiliating the kids and strengthening their dislike for Harriet.
Harriet's parents find out what she has done to her classmates and send her to be evaluated by a psychologist, who assures them that Harriet is fine. Then things start to get better again. Harriet gets her notebook back, and she even gets a surprise visit from Golly, who tells her that in order to make things right again, she has to do two things: apologize and lie. Harriet then tries to apologize to Sport and Janie, even though they reject her at first (they later, however, get tired of being treated unfairly in Marion's bully group and quit). She also shares her opinion with Miss Elson about how getting appointed as the editor of the sixth grade paper wasn't being done in a fair way, and she get selected herself by her classmates, who get Marion's occupation as the editor voted out. Through one article, she apologizes to everyone, including Marion, and all (except Marion) accept her apology. All is well. On opening night of the 6th grade pageant, Janie, Sport and Harriet light off a stink bomb as revenge on Marion and dance to James Brown's "Get Up Offa That Thing" until the end of the film.
The film was released in US theaters on July 10, 1996, and the film grossed $6,601,651 on its opening weekend, averaging about $3,615 per each of the 1,826 screens it was shown on. The film went on to gross a total of $26,570,048 by November 10, 1996, and is considered a modest box office success, earning back more than double its $12 million budget.
"Harriet the Spy" was released onto VHS on February 25, 1997. The film was later released on DVD on May 27, 2003, with no special features whatsoever.
The film has received mixed reviews from critics and it currently has a 48% "rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Another adaptation of "Harriet the Spy" was released as a television movie in 2010 entitled "", with Jennifer Stone from "Wizards of Waverly Place" in the title role.

<doc id="9366022" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9366022" title="De Vita Beata">
De Vita Beata

De Vita Beata ("On the Happy Life") is a dialogue written by Seneca the Younger around the year 58 AD. It was intended for his older brother Gallio, to whom Seneca also dedicated his dialogue entitled "De Ira" ("On Anger"). It is divided into 28 chapters that present the moral thoughts of Seneca at their most mature. Seneca explains that the pursuit of happiness is the pursuit of reason – reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature.
Seneca, in agreement with Stoic doctrine, argues that Nature is Reason ("logos") and that people must use their powers of reason to live in harmony with nature and thus achieve happiness. In his words, "rerum naturae adsentior; ab illa non deerrare et ad illius legem exemplumque formari sapientia est," which means "I follow nature; it is common sense not to stray from it but to be molded according to its law and example." Seneca proposes to follow a logical sequence in this approach, starting with the definition of the objectives that the person wants to obtain. In decision-making he scorns the ways of the masses ("the most beaten and frequented paths are the most deceptive") since people are "more willing to trust another than to judge for themselves" and "a mistake that has been passed on from hand to hand finally involves us and works our destruction."
In a certain sense he identifies Nature with God, which he states several times requires our obedience ("We were born into this kingdom and to obey to God is freedom", and he writes "when you rage against heaven I do not say, 'You are committing sacrilege,' but 'You are wasting your time.'"
Seneca presents a morality based on contempt for the pleasures ("pleasure is something lowly, servile, weak, and perishable") and fortune ("do not be corrupted by external things, be unconquerable and admire only oneself, be courageous in spirit and ready for any fate, be the moulder of one's own life"). But he admits that there are acceptable pleasures "calm, moderate, almost listless and subdued, and scarcely noticeable" linked to the conduct of the wise person.
The attainment of happiness, therefore, is only really possible by following Virtue who "like a good soldier will submit to wounds, count her scars, and, pierced by darts as she dies, will yet adore the general for whom she falls", because "no one can live cheerfully without living honourably." Thus, Seneca distinguishes between virtues hard or difficult and virtues soft or easier to practice, because "there is no virtue without effort". Among the difficult are patience, fortitude and perseverance, and among the easy are liberality, temperance and meekness.
As far as wealth is concerned, Seneca does not consider it good or bad in itself, but acknowledges that it is "useful and brings great comfort to life", so the wise person prefers them but is not subordinate to them. In this sense, wealth must be an instrument of virtue, using it to give to others, because "I shall proffer my bounty to some, and shall forcibly thrust it upon others".

The Assam Garden

The Assam Garden is a 1985 British drama film made by Moving Picture Company and distributed by Contemporary Films Ltd. The film was directed by Mary McMurray and produced by Nigel Stafford-Clark with Peter Jaques as associate producer. It was written by Elisabeth Bond. The music score was by Richard Harvey and the cinematography by Bryan Loftus.
The film stars Deborah Kerr and Madhur Jaffrey with Alec McCowen, Zia Mohyeddin, Anton Lesser and Iain Cuthbertson.
The film was shot at Priors Mesne in Aylburton, Gloucestershire, England. At certain times of the year the garden is opened as part of the NGS (Gardens open for Charity) Scheme. In addition part of the land owned by Priors Mesne and run by the owners is now a Deer Park.
The recently widowed and somewhat cold Mrs. Graham (Deborah Kerr) discovers that her late husband's expansive garden has been selected for consideration as a "Great British Garden". Mrs Graham then devotes her days to tending the garden that her husband had devoted his life to, in hopes of getting selected to this honor. While gardening, Mrs. Graham meets and develops a close friendship with her neighbor, Mrs. Lal. Through working in the garden with Mrs. Lal, Mrs. Graham finds some joy and warmth in life. However, Mrs. Lal is homesick for her native India and at the end of the film, returns to India, leaving Mrs. Graham alone again. Mrs. Graham also learns that her husband left debts behind and she may be forced to sell her house and her beloved garden, just when it looks like it has qualified for the Great British Garden list. The film ends with Mrs. Graham standing alone in the garden calling aloud to her late husband to not leave her.

Truncation error

In numerical analysis and scientific computing, truncation error is the error made by truncating an infinite sum and approximating it by a finite sum. For instance, if we approximate the sine function by the first two non-zero term of its Taylor series, as in formula_1 for small formula_2, the resulting error is a truncation error. It is present even with infinite-precision arithmetic, because it is caused by truncation of the infinite Taylor series to form the algorithm.
Often, truncation error also includes discretization error, which is the error that arises from taking a finite number of steps in a computation to approximate an infinite process. For example, in numerical methods for ordinary differential equations, the continuously varying function that is the solution of the differential equation is approximated by a process that progresses step by step, and the error that this entails is a discretization or truncation error. See Truncation error (numerical integration) for more on this.
Occasionally, round-off error (the consequence of using finite precision floating point numbers on computers) is also called truncation error, especially if the number is rounded by truncation.

Ahmed Barzani

Ahmed Barzani (1896–1969) (), also known as Khudan (), was the head of the Barzani tribe in Northern Iraq. Sheikh Ahmed is considered to be the architect of Barzan by bringing many different Kurdish tribes under his command and expanding Barzan region. Along with his younger brother Mustafa Barzani, he fought against the oppression of the Iraqi government in the 1920s and 1930s.
Barzani's teachings of love, patriotism, tolerance, respect, equality, sharing of wealth, acquiring knowledge, social reform and environmental protection were unprecedented during his time in Kurdistan. Barzan was at its heyday during his time.
The first of the major Barzani revolts took place in 1931 after Barzani, one of the most prominent Kurdish leaders in Northern Iraq, and succeeded in defeating a number of other Kurdish tribes.
He was later forced to flee to Turkey, where he was held in detention and then sent to exile in the south of Iraq. He headed Barzan’s largest revolution from 1931 to 1937 and gained the respect of many Iraqi Army generals who were fighting him, such as General Abdul-Jabar Barznji the commander of Iraqi Army in Barzan region.
Barzani was the center of focus of the British, Iraqi and Turkish discontent. He was very sympathetic to the Kurdish movements in the North led by Khoyboun (the Ararat Revolt). He received many Kurds who were seeking sanctuary in Barzan, including Kor Hussein Pasha. In September 1930, a Turkish military attaché in Baghdad told Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri Said, “the Turkish military operations in Ararat were very successful. The army will carry similar operations to the west of the Lake of Wan. We expect these operations to come to an end soon. The Turkish army will mobilize along the Iraq-Turkey border if the Iraqi Army moves against the Sheikh Barzan. In fact, Ismet Inonu complained to Nuri Said in Ankara that Sheikh Ahmed was supporting the insurrection in Ararat (see Archive E4976/1932/93, dated 4SEP1930)
Barzani was the first known Kurdish environmentalist and conservationist leader. He attempted to enforce certain regulation to maintain a clean environment. He prohibited, among other things:
Barzani rejected the traditional way of maintaining leadership within the same family. He emphasized that whoever takes the lead must be qualified for such a job. He condemned the corruption which was beginning to take part within the Kurdish Movement and was highly critical of ignoring the oppressed masses who were the victims of the movement’s failures. He is also credited with emphasizing that marriage should be voluntary: such freedom he considered a basic civil right and stressed it publicly.

Bank Negara Monetary Notes

Bank Negara Monetary Notes (BNMN) are securities issued by Bank Negara Malaysia replacing the existing Bank Negara Bills (BNB) for purposes of managing liquidity in both the conventional and Islamic financial market. The maturity of these issuances has been lengthened from one year to three years however, this is not intended to signal any targeted level of long-term interest rates. The Overnight Policy Rate remains the sole indicator of the monetary policy stance while short-term and long-term interest rates at other maturities will continue to be market determined, reflecting overall demand and supply conditions as well as prevailing interest rate expectations in the financial market. New issuances of BNMN may be issued either on a discounted or a coupon-bearing basis depending on investors' demand. Discount-based BNMN will be traded using the same market convention as the existing BNB and Malaysian Treasury Bills (MTB) while the coupon-based BNMN will adopt the market convention of Malaysian Government Securities (MGS).The inaugural issuance was on 8 December 2006 with an issue size of RM1. billion.
BNMN are tradable on yield basis (discounted rate) based on bands of remaining tenure (e.g., Band 4= 68 to 91 days to maturity). The standard trading amount is RM5 million, and it is actively traded in the secondary market.

Anomalous electric dipole moment

In particle physics, the anomalous electric dipole moment, or the electric dipole moment of a particle in short, is the electric dipole moment of a particle. There is a symmetry, the CP symmetry, which if exact and unbroken will predict an exactly zero electric dipole moment for particles. However, we know at least in the Yukawa sector from neutral kaon oscillations that CP is broken. Experiments have been performed to measure the electric dipole moment of various particles like the electron and the neutron. Many models beyond the standard model with additional CP-violating terms generically predict a nonzero electric dipole moment and are hence sensitive to such new physics. Instanton corrections from a nonzero θ term in quantum chromodynamics predict a nonzero electric dipole moment for the neutron (it is easier to measure the electric dipole moment in a neutral particle) which have not been observed. This is the strong CP problem and is a prediction of chiral perturbation theory.

Download to own

Download to own is a concept of legally downloading movies to your computer via a network such as the internet. Generally to obtain movies this way a user must have a broadband connection and an account from an internet distribution company.
Download-to-own movies are more convenient to watch, as opposed to having to find and insert a DVD into your computer because once it is saved on the hard drive it can be viewed instantly. Movies are saved on the hard drive, typically in AVI format, and are compressed using MPEG-4 or DivX compression formats.
Disadvantages to download-to-own movies are that they have generally large file sizes, usually from 600MB to over 1GB. They may take a long time to download, and will fill up a hard drive quickly. The movie may be accidentally deleted or lost through a hard drive crash, but with proper back up procedures, and the continuing drop in prices for larger hard drives becoming commonplace, these problems can be minimized.
Another disadvantage is that due to compression and other factors they rarely have the same image-quality as a regular DVD, much less than that of a high-definition format, and also often lack multi-channel audio. They may also be distributed in a DRM-protected format (such as through iTunes), which makes it difficult to play them on other portable devices, or to burn to a DVD to play on a television.

Naughty Baby

Naughty Baby is a live album by Maureen McGovern. It was recorded at Studio A at Clinton Recording Studios in New York City. The studio was converted into an intimate concert setting and invitations were sent to 150 guest.
The album consists of 24 songs that were all co-written by George Gershwin (Gershwin's brother Ira co-wrote the majority of the songs), one of them was a lost song entitled "A Corner of Heaven With You" (written ca. 1918 with lyrics by Lou Paley). In the selection of "My Man's Gone Now," McGovern just vocalizes and never sings. Between the songs "The Man I Love" and "Summertime," there is a piano solo that is provided by Jeff Harris. The last selection is a medley of two songs - "Love Is Here to Stay" and "Of Thee I Sing."
The last three pages inside the album cover contain liner notes from Michael Tilson Thomas, Roger Kellaway, Frances "Frankie" Gershwin Godowsky (sister of George and Ira Gershwin), Tommy Krasker, and Ron Barron respectively.
The album cover depicts McGovern wearing a black off-one-shoulder dress and gold earrings and short brown hair.

Maple Leaf Square

Maple Leaf Square is a multi-use complex and public square in Toronto, Canada. It is located to the west of the Air Canada Centre in Downtown Toronto in the former Railway Lands. The $500 million development was jointly developed by Cadillac Fairview, Lanterra and Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), who owns the nearby Air Canada Centre. The complex has of usable space covering on one city block.
The name of the square and complex is Maple Leaf Square, after the Toronto Maple Leafs that play in the Air Canada Centre next to the square.
On September 25, 2014, it was reported that official name of the square would be changed to Ford Square from Maple Leaf Square, after the Ford Motor Company of Canada's purchase of naming rights to the square. After public uproar to the rename, five days later, MLSE said that those reports were "premature and unfounded" and they would not get rid of the name. Instead, they announced that the square would be branded as the "Ford Fan Zone at Maple Leaf Square" due to a five-year sponsorship deal with Ford Canada.
Construction on the project began in January 2007.
The two glass and precast concrete towers are 65 storeys, containing 872 residential units, a 167-room Hotel LeGermain Boutique Hotel, of office space, of retail space, a daycare centre, a high-definition theatre that will broadcast Leafs TV and Raptors NBA TV 24-hours a day, and four levels of underground parking with nearly 900 spaces.
The retail complex includes a Longo's grocery, a sports bar called Real Sports Bar and Grill, a sports retail store called Real Sports Apparel, a fine dining restaurant called E11even, and a branch of the Toronto Dominion Bank. For residents, there is a rooftop garden and swimming pool. The development was designed to achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver status for the project's environmental sustainability. The LEED rating system recognizes leading-edge buildings that incorporate design, construction and operational practices that combine healthy, high-quality and high-performance advantages with reduced environmental impacts.
The building partly served as inspiration for HarborCenter, a multi use building being constructed near First Niagara Center in Buffalo, New York by Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills owner Terrence Pegula in many respects but most noticeably in the design of the restaurant inside where HarborCenter's 716 Food and Sport which was largely designed off of Maple Leaf Square's Real Sports Bar and Grill.
The public square has a capacity of 5,000 people, which hosts pre-game gatherings and other sports-related events.
In conjunction with the project, the Air Canada Centre itself on the side of Maple Leaf Square was renovated. The renovations included an atrium addition to the west side of the arena which abuts the plaza. The outside wall of the atrium features a 50 by video screen overlooking the plaza which was inspired by similar plazas at L.A. Live in Los Angeles, and Victory Park in Dallas. Games going on inside the arena are often displayed live on the outdoor screen.
The public square holds special outdoor viewings of playoff games by the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors. Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment, who owns both franchises, puts concession and merchandise stands on the square during said occasions. The presence of Raptors fans in the square during their 2015 and 2016 playoff runs have led the square to be nicknamed "Jurassic Park" (in reference to the film).

Moving Image Retoucher

Moving Image Retoucher (M.I.R.) is a software tool for real-time playback of movies, manual dust busting, wire removal and any other kind of moving image (film, video) repair. The tool offers a solution for film viewing and manual retouch and repair. For example, scanned hairs, dust spots, bad splices, tears and other defects can be fixed with the tool.
The tool uses only existing information as it is cloning content from other regions and images into the selected area. A so-called 'monocle' displays target and source at one glance. Adjustable softness and elliptic brushes are allowing to repair the targeted images. Auto-alignment compensates camera and object motion to support the operator. A micro-loop function (playback from buffered cache) permits to use M.I.R. in various resolutions (video, HD, 2k, 4k) on state-of-the-art computers.
The software supports most common file formats like QuickTime, DPX, Cineon, TIFF, TGA, JPG. M.I.R. is available on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X and runs on almost any modern standard PC hardware, that supports openGL. There is a free demo-version that permits full playback functionality but has restrictions in saving back the retouched images.

My Gal Sal (aircraft)

My Gal Sal is a B-17E-BO Flying Fortress whose pilot was forced to land it on the Greenland icecap during World War II. Many years later, it was recovered and taken to the USA to be restored. It is one of only three intact B-17E's in existence.
On 27 June 1942, B-17E, "41-9032" - part of the 342nd Bomb Squadron of the 97th Bomb Group - was one of 13 B-17s flying the Labrador-to-Greenland leg of a ferry flight to the United Kingdom as part of Operation Bolero, the military build-up in Europe. Inclement weather broke up the flight; five B-17s returned to Labrador, while the remainder continued on to Greenland. Over Greenland three of the aircraft were forced to land by the weather, including "My Gal Sal".
The airplane's propellers were damaged by the landing, which kept the engines from being run to generate power needed to use the radio. It took an entire day, but the crew cut off the tips of one of the propellers so that an engine could be run and they were able to make contact. The aircraft's crew camped in the B-17 for nine days until a rescue airplane could arrive. They had to hike the 26 miles to a lake where the rescue airplane had been able to land.
The aircraft was abandoned, not to be seen again until a 1964 overflight by a USAF reconnaissance aircraft. At that time, "My Gal Sal" appeared to be intact. Thirty-one years later, "My Gal Sal" was recovered from the ice, although high winds had flipped the plane completely over and damaged it. The plane was restored to a static configuration at Cincinnati-Blue Ash Airport (ICAO designation: KISZ) in Cincinnati and is now part of the collection of the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana.
On July 15, 1942, six P-38Fs of the 1st Fighter Group and their B-17 escort were also forced down on the Greenland icecap by inclement weather after unsuccessfully attempting to fly to Iceland. One of the P-38s has been recovered and restored as "Glacier Girl".

Prudence and the Pill

Prudence and the Pill is a 1968 British comedy film made by Twentieth Century-Fox. It was directed by Fielder Cook and Ronald Neame and produced by Kenneth Harper and Ronald J. Kahn from a screenplay by Hugh Mills, based on his own novel. The music score was by Bernard Ebbinghouse and the cinematography by Ted Moore.
The film stars Deborah Kerr and David Niven with Robert Coote, Irina Demick, Joyce Redman, Judy Geeson, Keith Michell, Michael Hordern and Edith Evans.
The film portrays the conflicting and comical attempts by five couples to avoid pregnancy by using contraceptive pills. All of their efforts are ultimately unsuccessful, with the result that all five of the women give birth the following year.
The story revolves around a wealthy London banker named Gerald Hardcastle (Niven) and his wife Prudence (Kerr), who live together unhappily, sleeping in separate bedrooms and speaking to each other only when necessary. The five couples in the film are (1) Gerald and his French mistress Elizabeth, or "Liz" (Demick), (2) Prudence and her doctor, Dr. Alan Hewitt (Michell), (3) the Hardcastles's maid Rose (Turner) and their chauffeur Ted (Armstrong), (4) Gerald's brother Henry (Coote) and his wife Grace (Redman), and (5) Henry and Grace's daughter Geraldine (Geeson) and her boyfriend Tony Bates (Dundas).
All of the couples want to use a birth-control pill called "Thenol", but none of them wants to admit it. Prudence, Grace, and Ted manage to acquire supplies of pills, Grace through a prescription written by Hewitt, and Ted from the
local chemist, or pharmacist, who happens to be a friend of his. However, Grace soon becomes pregnant, because Geraldine has been stealing her pills and replacing them with aspirin tablets. After Geraldine admits her pill-switching scheme to Grace and Grace tells Gerald about it, Gerald uses the scheme on Prudence to generate incriminating evidence of her affair.
Meanwhile, believing that Rose is too conservative to accept contraception, Ted puts his tablets in a vitamin bottle and tells her she needs them for her health. However, Rose is worried about becoming pregnant, so she switches the pills in her vitamin bottle with the pills in Prudence's Thenol bottle, just moments after Gerald replaces Prudence's Thenol with aspirin. The result, then, is that Rose unwittingly trades Ted's Thenol for Gerald's aspirin. She soon becomes pregnant, and Ted tells Gerald about the pills he gave her, but says nothing about telling her they were vitamins. When Gerald asks her why her Thenol pills failed to work, she asks him how he knew about them, thinking that he has already found out about her taking Prudence's pills, at which point they both realise that she has revealed her guilt.
Now knowing why Prudence is still not pregnant, Gerald buys more aspirin, determined to expose her relationship with Hewitt. This eventually works, as do whatever measures Grace took to keep her pills away from Geraldine. By the end of the film, Geraldine and Prudence are both expecting.
Eventually, Gerald gets into trouble with both Liz and Prudence. Liz grows dissatisfied in her covert relationship with Gerald, who has been hiding her from his family, and decides to leave him. Prudence finds the letter that Liz wrote to Gerald about her decision, and Gerald finds Hewitt's Thenol prescription for Prudence. At first, neither Gerald nor Prudence is willing to grant the other a divorce, but Prudence offers to take the blame after becoming pregnant, as long as Gerald will spare Hewitt's reputation. Gerald accepts this arrangement grudgingly, but before meeting with Hewitt, he happens to see Liz while driving through town, and she tells him she is going to have his baby. Now able to see her openly, and with a child on the way, Gerald quickly and enthusiastically agrees to an amicable divorce. A few months later, a total of six newborn babies arrive, Rose having had twins.

International Industrial Bank (in Russian: Международный Промышленный Банк, often abbreviated as Mezhprombank, Межпромбанк, or MPB, МПБ) is one of the largest Russian banks founded in 1992 by Sergey Pugachyov and Sergey Veremeyenko.
On July 6, 2010, IIB failed to pay €200 million in maturing eurobonds. The bank is in discussions with bondholders, the Central Bank of Russia, and depositors to stabilize its deteriorating liquidity position.
On 30 November 2010, a Moscow court declared the bankruptcy and the insolvency of this bank.
In 2006, the bank uncovered that OPK Trust Company based in New Zealand owns 100 percent share of it. OPK Trust Company is controlled by Sergey Pugachyov.
Sergey Pugachyov, in the past a member of the Federation Council of Russia representing Tuva, had been the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Mezhprombank until January 2002.
On November 26, 2001, Novaya Gazeta published an article by Oleg Lurie claiming that the management of the bank had been involved in money laundering in the Bank of New York. The International Industrial Bank in response brought a libel suit against the newspaper citing financial losses, as a number of its customers had allegedly changed the terms of their accounts in a loss-making way because of the publication. On February 28, 2002, the bank won the case in Moscow's Basmanny municipal court and was awarded 15 million rubles (about $500,000) in lost revenue, an unprecedented sum for Russian newspapers. In April the decision was reconfirmed by a court. However, in an article of May 27, 2002., Yulia Latynina, a journalist of Novaya Gazeta, revealed that the bank's three customers named in the lawsuit were its subsidiaries or otherwise controlled by its board of directors, and claimed that Novaya Gazeta had requested to open a criminal fraud investigation into the activities of the bank. As a result, in June 2002 the bank renounced its claim to the compensation.

Foscoe, North Carolina

Foscoe is an unincorporated community in Watauga County, North Carolina, United States. The community is located on NC 105, southwest of Boone.
The community is bound between Seven Devils and Shulls Mill. Multiple shops dot along the main highway, selling anything that relates to the area that tourist expect to find. Its development, since the 1980s, is thanks to year-round tourism to nearby area attractions; notably Grandfather Mountain, where visitors can make out an "old man with beard" on the mountain.
Historically, the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (Nicknamed "Tweetsie") passed through the area until flooding destroyed the tracks in 1940. In 1956, NC 105 was built over the original rail bed through the area.

Hovercraft (band)

Hovercraft was an instrumental experimental rock group that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1993. It was co-founded by its core duo of guitarist/samplist/tape looper Ryan Shinn, and bassist Beth Liebling. Liebling and Shinn would use the pseudonyms "Sadie 7" and "Campbell 2000", respectively, throughout the duration of the band's history. Hovercraft has been cited as one of the most abrasive, non-commercial sounding bands ever to receive major-label distribution for its albums. Though somewhat overlooked and sometimes heavily criticized because of the band's early association with a platinum-selling rock star, the group was largely well respected and well received by critics and developed a cult following.
Beth Liebling and Ryan Shinn met in an anatomy class for surgical students. Prior to forming the trio Hovercraft, Liebling and Shinn played together in Space Helmet. Space Helmet broke up when Shinn moved to New York and the other members of Space Helmet, including Shinn's brother, formed the band Magnog. Shinn's departure for New York was short and upon his return, Hovercraft was formed.
Hovercraft's material consisted of lengthy songs featuring an avant-garde and moody sound that was a direct reaction to the local grunge scene. Hovercraft's sound came to be characterized by the sounds a bee makes, which made heavy use of delay and reverb on Shinn's main guitar, a Fender Stratocaster. The use of looping effects enabled Shinn to often simulate the simultaneous playing of multiple guitarists, though he was always the lone guitarist, both in the studio and onstage. Leibling generally played single-note, ominous, pulsating bass lines, played "clean" (with no effects). Early drum beats were generally sparse, yet jazzy. The band became more complex as the band gradually added more highly skilled drummers over the years.
On January 8, 1995, recordings by Hovercraft and Magnog were played back to back on Pearl Jam's "Self-Pollution" satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long pirate broadcast out of Seattle, Washington which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it. The tracks which followed immediately after Pearl Jam's final set are described by Eddie Vedder as a "cleansing of the palate." The recording would appear on Hovercraft's first release, a seven-inch single on the band's own Repellent Records. Recorded in August 1994, "Zero Zero Zero One" featured Bobby Tamkin aka "Paul 4" on drums and on "box of nails." No track titles were given, but "0001-A" and "0001-B" are etched into either band of the vinyl sides. It was also released as a VHS tape "video single" in a simple black slipcase.
The single was initially handed out at gigs; stickers affixed to the plastic slip of ones sold in stores boasted, "Featuring Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam." However, the single featured Bobby Tamkin on drums, not Vedder as rumored. "Paul 4" is the pseudonym of early member Bobby Tamkin, currently with his own band, Xu Xu Fang, and former drummer of The Warlocks. In 1995, Hovercraft accepted a slot opening for Mike Watt on his U.S. tour. Hovercraft, and Dave Grohl's new band Foo Fighters, played short sets before both Grohl and Vedder would join headliner Watt as members of his band. This was Hovercraft's first tour, as well as the first major tour for Grohl since the suicide of Kurt Cobain. Hovercraft toured later that year with Sky Cries Mary.
Though Vedder donned a long wig in order to conceal his face somewhat, his true identity soon become widely known. Subsequent Hovercraft tours would often be flooded with fans of the Pearl Jam frontman. During the Watt tour, Vedder was replaced by Bobby Tamkin's return to the band. Tamkin left the band following the tour, and was soon replaced by former Pearl Jam drummer, Dave Krusen, who adopted the stage name "Karl 3-30." Hovercraft toured in 1995 opening for Sweet 75. (Like Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic's first tour following Cobain's suicide featured Hovercraft). Hovercraft would join Sky Cries Mary and Sweet 75 for Microsoft and World Domination Recordings' joint "Transmissions from Space" tour in November 1995, an interactive, multi-media exposition highlighting the new CD Plus technology.
Live shows were marked by a stage prepared in advance of entrance by crowds. When the band did enter, not a word was uttered, and eye contact was never made with spectators. The stage was shrouded in darkness as a projector played black & white scientific films and space-themed documentary clips from the reel-to-reel era (1940s-1970s), and free-use stock footage, somewhat synchronized to the music. Examples of film material include insects mating, time-lapse footage of flowers blooming, and asteroids crashing. Though often featuring fragments of album tracks, each live show was played as a single forty- to forty-five-minute-long semi-improvised piece with no breaks. The film collages were created by Shinn and Liebling, and were altered for each tour the band went on. According to Shinn, the band used films in their concerts "since the very first show."
The group's artwork, album and song titles ("Haloparidol", "Vagus Nerve", "Phantom Limb", "Endoradiosonde" (a kind of "Radio Transmittor Pill", "Benzedrine", "De-Orbit Burn") featured foreboding themes of medical, astronautical and scientific experimentation, satellite imagery, hallucinations, and medical conditions. Though these are common in the post-rock, space rock and avant-garde music scenes, Hovercraft's are likely bolstered by Shinn and Liebling's medical/scientific training, as well as their youths:
Group photos distributed to the press were also shot in silhouette, contributing further to the group's shadowy mystique, though a photo of the group does appear inside "Akathisia", though Liebling is obscured by darkness. Recorded on two days in March and April 1996, the ten-inch format of "Stereo Specific Polymerization", also released on the Liebling-run Repellent, allowed for recordings that more closely approximated their live sound.
In August 1996, the band appeared on a hidden track on the Germs tribute album "A Small Circle of Friends". Allegedly recorded in a "L.A. garage" in order "to capture the Germs feel", Hovercraft's contribution is a sixteen-minute-long, mostly instrumental reprise of "Shutdown". The track, which follows a more conventional version of the song by Monkeywrench, features a conversation in Italian between Shinn and Liebling, making it the only recording by the band to feature any vocalization.
After running the small club circuit of the North America a few times on their own, the band supported Unwound on a European tour. Hovercraft even opened for classic rockers The Who on a short series of stadium concerts in the Northwestern United States in late 1996.
In 1997, the band were signed to Blast First Records in London by label head Paul Smith. In North America, debut album (released as double-LP and single CD) "Akathisia" was distributed by Mute Records America. Ned Raggett of Allmusic said that "the trio on "Akathisia" did a fantastic job of whipping up five dark, engrossing instrumentals that avoided any pretense of commercial acceptance." "Akathisia"'s liner notes state that the album was "preserved and magnetically encoded 12.1995."
The vinyl etchings on the four sides of "Akathisia" were as follows:
(This was the slogan of the cult classic 1980s Gottlieb pinball game, Black Hole.)
The new lineup played at the first Terrastock festival in Providence, Rhode Island, in April 1997. The band then toured with Japan's Kirihito and American rock band Caustic Resin, and handled the opening slot on a tour with Fugazi, as well as a tour opening for Helmet and The Melvins. An EP featuring remixes of two truncated "Akathisia" songs by Scanner was released later in 1997.
1998 brought yet another change of drummer as Ric Peterson took the stool as "Dash 11". His much harder-hitting, more visceral style was the apparent catalyst in the band's shift from ethereal 15-minute songs to more concise, angular arrangements. The track "Epoxy" from the band's upcoming album first premiered for the world on Pearl Jam's "Monkeywrench Radio" broadcast, on January 31, 1998.
One year in the making, Hovercraft's final album, "Experiment Below", was released in September 1998. Jason Kaufman of Allmusic said, "This is challenging music that certainly has its rewards for those patient enough to hang around." In 1998 and 1999, Hovercraft toured Europe again with Add N to (X), and the United States with the Boredoms, The Melvins, and Mr. Bungle. The band also played a number of one-off shows with Wire, Sleater-Kinney, Hater, Mudhoney, and IQU.
Hovercraft teamed up with Stereolab guitarist/backing vocalist Mary Hansen, forming the band Schema. Schema featured vocals and instrumentals in approximately equal measure, adding some synthesizer. An eponymous maxi-EP/mini-album was released in 2000 on avant-garde Kill Rock Stars imprint, 5 Rue Christine. A second album and a tour was planned. However, while riding her bicycle in London on December 12, 2002, the 36-year-old Hansen was struck by a truck and killed.
Hovercraft and DJ Spooky worked on remixes of each other's works in the late 1990s; two DJ Spooky remixes of Hovercraft songs were released (on various-artist techno compilation albums), but Hovercraft's versions of his songs were never released. Hovercraft's last live performance was on February 16, 2001, at the Experience Music Project museum in Seattle.

Hawaii Calls

Hawaii Calls was a radio program that ran from 1935 through 1975 that featured live Hawaiian music conducted by Harry Owens for the first two years, the composer of "Sweet Leilani". Ray Andrade was a charter member of the Harry Owens Royal Hawaiian Hotel Orchestra, he also became one of the first vocalists on the “Hawaii Calls” radio show. It was broadcast each week, usually from the courtyard of the Moana Hotel on Waikiki Beach but occasionally from other locations, and hosted by Webley Edwards for almost the entire run.
The first show reached the West Coast of the continental United States through shortwave radio. At its height, it was heard on over 750 stations around the world. However, when it went off the air in 1975, only 10 stations were airing the show. Because of its positive portrayal of Hawaii, the show received a subsidy for many years—first from the government of the Territory of Hawaii, and then from the State of Hawaii. The termination of the subsidy was one of the reasons that the show went off the air.
"Hawaii Calls" is credited with making many Hawaiian performers household names across the US and around the world. Among the regulars of "Hawaii Call" were Alfred Apaka, John Kameaaloha Almeida, Haunani Kahalewai, Nina Keali'iwahamana, Boyce Rodrigues, Lani Custino, and Pua Almeida. Other well known Hawaiian performers such as Martin Denny, Hilo Hattie, Ed Kenny, Benny Kalama, hula dancer Beverly Noa and Arthur Lyman also made appearances. The show also occasionally featured performers from other parts of the world who sang or played Hawaiian music.
Each show opened with the sounds of the pounding surf and the enthusiastic bounding voice of Webley Edwards proclaiming, "The sound of the waves on the beach at Waikiki."
During the height of the show's popularity (1950s and into the late 1960s/early 1970s) Webley Edwards served the role of producer of numerous records, released on the Capitol Records label, under the title of "Webley Edwards present Hawaii Calls." The albums contained renditions of popular Hawaiian and "hapa haole" songs as arranged by the "Hawaii Calls" musicians. In addition to appearing on the many "Hawaii Calls" albums, many of the stars of "Hawaii Calls" also enjoyed successful careers as solo artists
Several of the "Hawaii Calls" CD releases listed below are still in print and available from Mele.com. There are also several compact disc compilations released by Hula Records, the company that owns the rights to the "Hawaii Calls" name and the show's surviving archives. They feature also songs from some of the classic radio shows and may include Edwards' colorful commentary. These are available at www.hularecords.com.
In 1992, "Hawaii Calls" hosted by Bill Bigelow was revived for a one-year run at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, but it failed to attract enough financial support to continue. A one-night "Hawaii Calls" show that combined live performances and archival audio and video material was presented at the Hawaii Theater in Honolulu, Hawaii on Friday, November 14, 2008. The show was co-produced by Burton White, Artistic Director of the Hawaii Theatre, and Don McDiarmid Jr., Chairman of Hawaii Calls Inc., and President Emeritus of Hula Records. The show included live performances by vocalists Nina Keali'iwahamana and Aaron Sala, hula dancer Kanoe Miller, and the Hawaii Calls Quintet including Sally (Sarah) Kamalani, and also archival performances by Alfred Apaka, Lani Custino, Hilo Hattie, Haunani Kahalewai, Ed Kenny, Charles Kaipo Miller, Beverly Noa, Ponce Ponce and Boyce Rodrigues. Webley Edwards was shown introducing some of the archival performances and audio clips of his voice were used to introduce most of the live performances.

Big Four of Maryland Thoroughbred racing

The Big Four of Maryland Thoroughbred racing were four American Thoroughbred horse trainers who dominated horse racing in the state of Maryland in the 1960 and 1970s and who helped modernize flat racing training.
The "Big Four" label evolved within the racing community and the media as a way to recognize the influence of trainers John J. Tammaro, Jr. (1925-2001), Richard E. Dutrow, Sr. (1937-1999), King T. Leatherbury (born 1933), and Hall of Fame inductee, Grover G. "Bud" Delp (1932-2006).

Arthur Hazlerigg, 1st Baron Hazlerigg

Arthur Grey Hazlerigg, 1st Baron Hazlerigg (17 November 1878 – 25 May 1949), known as Sir Arthur Grey Hazlerigg, 13th Baronet, from 1890 to 1945, was a British peer.
Hazlerigg was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Grey Hazlerigg, and Jane Edith Orr-Ewing, daughter of Sir Archibald Orr-Ewing, 1st Baronet. Sir Arthur Hesilrige, 2nd Baronet, was an ancestor. His father died when he was only one year old and in 1890, aged 11, he succeeded his grandfather as thirteenth Baronet, of Noseley Hall. He played first-class cricket for Leicestershire from 1907 to 1910, captaining the county during that period. He made 65 appearances for the county. He later served as High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1909 and as Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire from 1925 to 1949. On 12 February 1945 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hazlerigg, of Noseley in the County of Leicester, for his services to the county of Leicestershire.
Lord Hazlerigg married Dorothy Rachel Buxton, daughter of John Henry Buxton, in 1903. He died in May 1949, aged 70, and was succeeded in his titles by his son Arthur. Lady Hazlerigg died in 1972.
He stood for the Conservatives in 1906 but was unsuccessful.

Cape Bonavista

Cape Bonavista is a headland located on the east coast of the island of Newfoundland in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is located at the northeastern tip of the Bonavista Peninsula, which separates Trinity Bay to the south from Bonavista Bay to the north. The nearby town of Bonavista takes its name from this historic landmark. The lighthouse on Cape Bonavista was built in 1843.
John Cabot may have landed at this site on June 24, 1497 with his second expedition to North America (or at another time in the 15th century). Other Newfoundland locations also claim to be his landing site.

Dyle Plan

The Dyle Plan or D Plan was the primary war plan of the French Army to stave off the expected German attack during "Fall Gelb". It was conceived by French General Maurice Gamelin in 1940. Named after the Dyle River, which flows from southern Belgium down to Antwerp, the main objective of the plan was to halt the advancing German Army Group B, (which was incorrectly regarded as the strongest), in central Belgium. France had signed a military treaty with Belgium in 1920 to streamline communication and fortification efforts in the event of a German attack, but in October 1936 Belgium changed her policy to one of strict neutrality, limiting coordination of defense plans with France.
Gamelin initially proposed the less risky "E (Escaut) Plan", which called for a defense (except for the extreme west in Flanders) based upon a series of fortifications along much of the actual Belgian-French border rather than in Belgium proper. However, Gamelin eventually decided to adopt the Dyle Plan with the argument that the new anti-tank defences built by Belgium along the Dyle and at the Gembloux Gap allowed for a quick entrenchment of the Allied armies. Adopting the Dyle Plan also afforded the French 7th Army an opportunity to link up with the Dutch forces via Breda in The Netherlands, a dangerous gamble since the 7th Army was the French strategic reserve. However, the newly fashioned anti-tank defences at Gembloux proved rather inadequate. Nevertheless, the 1st French army held fast against the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions, until forced to retreat towards Lille because of the German penetration in the south. Lord Gort expected that his British Expeditionary Force (BEF) would have two or three weeks to prepare for the Germans to arrive at the Dyle; they were there in four days.
When German leader Adolf Hitler heard of the Allies' advance to the Dyle, he said "I could have wept for joy, they had fallen into the trap". The Dyle Plan played into the hands of the Germans who executed their main attack (the Manstein Plan), through the Ardennes, on the assumption that the Allies would advance into central Belgium. The BEF and the French First and Seventh Armies were surrounded and would have been totally annihilated if it had not been for an impromptu evacuation from Dunkirk. The Dyle Plan was a fundamental flaw in the Allied strategy and one of the decisive factors contributing to the Allied defeat in the Battle of France. According to British historian Julian Jackson, the fall of France can be greatly attributed to the choice by Gamelin to send the French strategic reserve, the 7th army, far from the main German thrust, which made him unable to react to the German plans.

2N3904

The 2N3904 is a common NPN bipolar junction transistor used for general purpose low-power amplifying or switching applications. The type was registered by Motorola Semiconductor in the mid-sixties, together with the complementary PNP type 2N3906, and represented a significant performance/cost improvement, with the plastic TO-92 case replacing metal cans. It is designed for low current and power, medium voltage, and can operate at moderately high speeds. This transistor is low cost, widely available and sufficiently robust to be of use by experimenters and electronics hobbyists. When looking at the flat side with the leads pointed downward, the three wires emerging from the bottom are connected to, from left to right, the emitter, the base and the collector. Some manufacturers mark "EBC" on the molded part, but all are required to have those connections for a part which is a "2N3904".
It is a 200 mA, 40 volt, 625 milliwatt transistor with a transition frequency of 300 MHz, with a minimum beta or current gain of 100 at a collector current of 10 mA. It is used in a variety of analog amplification and switching applications.
Electrically similar devices, such as the MMBT3904, are available in a variety of small through-hole and surface mount packages including TO-92, SOT-23, and SOT-223, with package-dependent thermal ratings from 625 milliwatts to 1 watt.
A 2N3906 is a complementary (PNP) transistor for the 2N3904. The 2N2222 is an NPN transistor that can safely switch three times as much current as the 2N3904 but has otherwise similar characteristics. Nevertheless, in many applications such as variable frequency oscillators where lower currents are used to minimize thermal heating and consequent thermal drift of the fundamental frequency, the greater current capacity of the 2N2222 gives it no advantage. Whereas the 2N2222 is optimized to reach its highest gain at currents of around 150 mA, the 2N3904 is optimized for currents of around 10 mA.
The 2N3904 is used very frequently in hobby electronics projects including home-made ham radios, code practice oscillators and as an interfacing device for micro-controllers.

<doc id="9366470" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9366470" title="Greensand Ridge">
Greensand Ridge

The Greensand Ridge is an extensive, prominent, often wooded, mixed greensand/sandstone escarpment in south-east England. It runs to and from the East Sussex coast, around the Weald, a former dense forest in Sussex, Surrey and Kent. It reaches its highest elevation, , at Leith Hill in Surrey—the second highest point in south-east England, while another hill in its range, Blackdown, is the highest point in Sussex at . The eastern end of the ridge forms the northern boundary of Romney Marsh.
The Greensand Ridge, formed of Lower Greensand, much of which is sandstone and where hardest is locally termed Bargate stone, is a remnant of the Weald dome, part of the great Weald-Artois Anticline that runs from south-east England into northern France.
The Weald dome consists of a series of geological strata laid down in the Cretaceous that have subsequently been lifted up, formed into a dome (i.e. anticline) and then deformed and faulted. The top-most and therefore youngest layer of the dome is Chalk, laid down in the Upper Cretaceous. Below it lie successively older strata of alternating clays and sandstones laid down in the Lower Cretaceous, namely Upper Greensand, Gault Clay, Lower Greensand, Weald Clay and the Hastings Beds. Differential fluvial erosion has virtually flattened the dome into a series of hills and vales. On the surface the strata of which the dome is composed crop out in a series of concentric circles, shaped like a horseshoe, with the more resistant chalk and sandstones forming hills and ridges (such as the North and South Downs, the Greensand Ridge, and the High Weald), and the weaker clays forming vales (such as the Low Weald) between them. The very resistant rocks of the Lower Greensand, in particular the Hythe Beds, have produced prominent escarpments that form an arc around the northern edge of the Low Weald, running parallel to and just south of the chalk escarpment of the North Downs. This stretch of the Greensand has become the most closely identified with the term "Greensand Ridge", and it includes the second highest point in south-east England, Leith Hill in Surrey. West of the Weald the Lower Greensand has produced a more extensive area of hills and valleys, including the highest point in Sussex, Blackdown. On the south side of the Weald the Lower Greensand also forms another arc of rather less pronounced hills parallel to and just north of the South Downs, which become less prominent the further east one goes.
The Lower Greensand is a predominantly arenaceous sandstone consisting of sediment that accumulated apparently in a shallow sea in the later part of the Lower Cretaceous. It also contains important subsidiary elements of silty and argillaceous material. Chert, ironstone and calcareous deposits occur in small amounts. When fresh the rocks have a greenish colouration owing to the presence of glauconite, but on exposure to the atmosphere this is rapidly oxidised to limonite, giving rise to a yellow or reddish brown staining.
The Lower Greensand is composed of alternating mudstones (sandy, with clay particles such as smectite) and sandstones, up to a maximum thickness of about , and is composed of a number of distinct formations, namely the Folkestone Beds, Sandgate Beds, Bargate Beds, Hythe Beds and Atherfield Clay.
The soil of the Greensand is quite varied, ranging from fertile to fairly sterile. On the fertile soils we see chestnut and stands of hazel and oak, while Scots Pine and Birch colonise the poorer soils.
Broadly speaking, the Greensand Ridge runs along the northern edge of the Weald in a west-east arc from Surrey into Kent, just south of and parallel to the chalk escarpment of the North Downs. The ridge is separated by a mixed deep and shallow, fertile depression from the North Downs referred to as the 'Vale of Holmesdale', formed on Gault Clay, and a narrow band of Upper Greensand that outcrops at the foot of the chalk scarp (ridge). In some places the clay vale is very narrow: for example at Oxted the gap between summits of the Greensand Ridge and the North Downs is less than .
The Greensand Ridge, capped by the resistant sands and sandstones of the Hythe Beds, reinforced by bands of chert, rises steeply as a series of high, wooded escarpments between Gibbet Hill, Hindhead (), north of Haslemere, and the ridge's highest point, Leith Hill (). It then flattens for several miles, before re-emerging east of Nutfield to run eastwards as a high wooded ridge into an area between Oxted and Sevenoaks known locally as the "Chartlands", where it reaches another high point at Toys Hill, Kent (). Here there are stunning views to the south of the Weald from a terrace donated in 1898 by Octavia Hill, one of the founders of the National Trust. The ridge continues eastwards past Sevenoaks, until south-west of Maidstone it is broken by the valley of the River Medway. The ridge then continues as far as Pluckley, Kent. From there the land levels until it drops to the old sea-cliff line above Romney Marsh.
In the area around Haslemere local anticlinal features are superimposed on the main axis of the Wealden anticline, causing the outcrop of resistant Hythe Beds to widen from to more than and to produce an escarpment that is particularly marked between Haslemere and Midhurst, where Blackdown rises to , the highest point in Sussex. South of here the Vale of Fernhurst has been eroded down into the Low Weald by what is now a small stream following a line of a gentle west-east trending upfold. This stream, the River Lod, runs parallel to the larger River Rother which flows about 10 km further south in the lee of the chalk escarpment of the South Downs. Valley slope processes in the Vale of Fernhurst have resulted in escarpments to the north and south that are steep enough to have collapsed by land slipping. Further east, the Lower Greensand has not produced any pronounced topographical features.
In many places along the escarpment of the Greensand Ridge erosion by wind and rain, landslips on the steep scarp face, and solifluction in glacial times have further combined to create steep-side coombes, and low hillocks below the scarp.
The Greensand Ridge is sometimes associated with the Weald; the ridge forms the high border of area of the Weald.
The Jutes and Saxons who settled in south-east England in the centuries following the collapse of the Roman empire applied the term "Weald" (a Germanic term for woodland) to the very large, heavily wooded forest that they found lying inland of the coastal lands and river valleys that they initially settled. This forest, difficult to penetrate and settle, and difficult to exploit agriculturally, in due course became an essential part of a system of transhumance whereby each autumn swine would be driven, sometimes over long distances, from the longer-settled areas on the periphery into the Wealden forest to feed on acorns of oak trees and beech mast. For these peoples the term "Weald" did not include the land cleared of forest and settled earlier, such as the fertile Vale of Holmesdale (which separates the North Downs from the Greensand Ridge), nor the more lightly wooded and open hills found on the sandstones of the Greensand Ridge, which also seem to have been settled earlier. Local people regarded the hills of the Greensand Ridge as overlooking the Weald, rather than forming a part of it, and hence a distinction came to be made between the settlements on the Greensand Ridge, such as Sevenoaks, Sundridge Upland and Boughton Malherbe Upland, and those formed during the later medieval colonisation of the Wealden portion of these parishes, called today Sevenoaks Weald, Sundridge Weald and Boughton Malherbe Weald.
A practice of treating the Greensand Ridge regularly as part of the Weald arose in geology when natural scientists, starting in the late 18th century, began to include it in their analysis of the geological history of the Wealden dome. Geology still confuses by using interchangeably the Weald and the "Wealden Anticline" that embraces all the land bounded by the chalk escarpments of the North and South Downs, including the Greensand hills.
The Folkestone Beds consist of seams of pebbles and sand. It is from here that the stone known as chert is found, familiar in the High Chart hills around Limpsfield, Surrey. In Surrey the Sandgate Beds and Bargate Beds, which lie on top of the Hythe Beds, have yielded a distinctive yellow stone seen in many local buildings. Ironstone, from layers embedded in the Sandgate Beds, is often seen in chips (gallets) pressed into the mortar between such stones. To the east, especially around Maidstone, Kent, the Hythe Beds yield a blue-grey sandstone with a high lime content. Known as ragstone, this is seen in many local buildings.
Fuller's earth, which lies interbedded between the Bargate and Sandgate Layers, was much quarried for the cloth industry. The seam, which lies about 20 to 30 feet below the surface between Nutfield and Bletchingley, was considered the best in the country and for several centuries large quantities were excavated. Resources are now running low and little is now extracted.
Principal settlements lying on the southern part of the Greensand in Sussex, adjacent to the South Downs, include Storrington (at the eastern end of the ridge) and Midhurst. Petersfield marks the western end, where the ridge turns north east. Settlements on the main part of the ridge, running from Surrey into Kent include Haslemere, Godalming, Reigate and Redhill, Oxted and Sevenoaks.
Much of the ridge in Surrey and Kent is followed by a long-distance walking route, the Greensand Way. Extending for 108 miles, it starts in the west at Haslemere and ends in the east at Ham Street, Kent, on the edge of Romney Marsh. The route passes through or close to Godalming, Cranleigh, Dorking, Reigate, South Nutfield, Oxted, Westerham, Sevenoaks, Maidstone and Ashford.
The south-west part of the Greensand ridge and hills is in the South Downs National Park. Much of the Greensand Ridge in Surrey is one limb of the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty while a section of the Greensand hills in western Kent, from Limpsfield Chart near Westerham through Sevenoaks to Plaxtol, forms part of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, where it is known as the "Sevenoaks Greensand Ridge".

Richard III (1699 play)

Richard III (1699) is an adapted version of Shakespeare's history play of the same name (1591), reworked for Williamite or "Orange" audiences by Colley Cibber.
Some modern catalogues such as ECCO list the play as Cibber's work, others, such as EEBO, offer Shakespeare as the author and reduce Cibber's role to that of an author and theatre expert who simply adapted the play.
Cibber, a noted theatre manager, first attempted to stage his version in 1699. The performance was a disaster. The Master of the Revels censored the entire first act, which Cibber had completely redesigned. Cibber published his version (1700), including the problematic act, with a short note on its suppression. Ensuing performances from 1704 eventually risked the entire play in Cibber's new form. The play became a success with leading actors such as David Garrick playing Richard.
The Shakespeare renaissance of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries deprecated modifications of Shakespeare's plots. Cibber's adaptation could not stand comparison with Shakespearean originals.
The historical background shows the play in reference to the reigning of King Edward IV before it represents the events of the reigning of King Richard III during the Wars of the Roses. The end of the play reflects the accession of the throne through Richmond, descendent of the Tudor family and future King Henry VII.
Shakespeare's play summarises actions around the year 1485, although the actual historical events of the play proceeded over a much longer period. The years 1471–1485, during which Richard gained power and was able to rise to the throne of England, are presented to the audience in five acts. The main events take place in London, preferably in the Tower. Other places in the capital are presented, namely different streets, the palace and different houses. Away from London, the camp and battlefield at Bosworth Fields are shown. The first print version of the tragedy that Shakespeare published does neither have a subdivision into acts and scenes nor does it list any places or stage directions, but the reader can conclude this information from the text. Direct information is only given in later editions. Furthermore, the play does not reflect the time frame in an obvious manner. It does not become clear which actions take place at what specific time or how much time actually passes during the play.
Shakespeare's first Act begins with Richard secretly aspiring to the throne—during which process he decides to kill anyone he has to become king. For the purpose of ascending to the throne he tricks Lady Anne in the second act into marrying him, even though she knows he murdered her first husband and her father-in-law.
The reigning King Edward dies and leaves the throne waiting for the elder of his two sons Edward and Richard. The third act sees Richard, Duke of Gloucester, left in charge until Edward will come of age. Richard has powerful kinsmen of Edward's wife, Queen Elizabeth, arrested and executed, which leaves the two young princes unprotected. In the fourth act, Richard has his political allies, particularly his right-hand man, Lord Buckingham, campaign to have himself crowned king. Richard then imprisons the young princes in the Tower and sends hired murderers to kill both children. Rumours spread that a challenger to the throne is gathering forces in France.
Whilst Richard still tries to consolidate his powers, his fellowmen are ready to welcome a new ruler. Richard has his wife Anne murdered, so that he can marry young Elizabeth, the daughter of the former Queen Elizabeth and the dead King Edward. Richmond and Richard finally meet in battle at Bosworth Field. The night before the fight Richard is haunted by ghosts of all the people he has killed. In the battle on the following morning, Richard is killed, and Richmond is crowned King Henry VII, which concludes the fifth act.
Even though Cibber takes fewer than 800 lines from Shakespeare, he stays for the most part with the original design, mainly adapting the plot to make it more suitable for the Orange stage, as well as performable in less than two hours. Cibber did add aspects and scenes and therefore created plot extensions; nevertheless his adaptation leaves out several Shakespearean characters and passages.
Cibber contrived a completely new opening act, including the murder of Henry VI taken from the play Henry VI, Part 3; this event is entirely left out in the original.
Parts from the original first act are mentioned in the course of Cibber’s adaptation. One example is the conversation between Lady Anne and Richard in Cibber's second act, after the death of King Henry VI, in St. Paul's Cathedral. Another is Tressel's lines, "Your Queen yet Lives, and many of your Friends, / But for my Lord your Son---" (Cibber I.i), dealing with the report to King Henry of his son's death, are also taken from Henry VI, Part 3.
New scene: between Lady Ann and Richard, after marriage, during which they have an argument.
Newly created monologues: Seven newly designed soliloquies for the main character were created for the actor Samuel Sandford. But as Sandford was not part of Drury Lane actors' repertory, he was not able to perform the role of Richard, and Cibber himself played the part in the first performance.
The character of Queen Margaret is ignored completely. In the original she appears in I.iii and in IV.iv. The loss of this character does not have a striking effect on the plot and can therefore be accepted. It actually ensures a less supernatural and more rational appearance of the play, as the character just gives information on actions taking place off stage and offers hints for the audience.
Reduced use of ghosts: Both versions include the appearance of ghosts of the murdered characters of King Henry, Lady Ann and the two Princes. However, Cibber reduces the interplay between the dead and still living characters by allowing the ghosts to appear only before Richard and not Richmond, the later King Henry VII. With only Richard and nobody else seeing the ghosts, the King is referred to as being a little wicked.
Simplification: In contrast to Shakespeare’s version the ghosts of Rivers, Grey, Vaughan, Hastings –all servants to the Queen– and Richard’s brother Clarence do not emerge on stage.
While Shakespeare keeps violent scenes mainly in the dark, Cibber shows his audience many more violent actions, giving a more brutal picture of the main character as well as a more dramatic and entertaining piece of performance.
Off-stage: Shakespeare never brings the two princes back to the stage after they have been guided to the Tower. He points out Richard's intentions of killing his two nephews by having the Duke talk to Tyrell about the murder of the two. Tyrell is willing to kill the princes and leaves the stage. He reappears after the deed is done and gives an account of the death of the two. The actual murder is not referred to and Tyrell only mentions that he has seen the dead bodies.
On-stage: Cibber shows the murder. The Duke orders Tyrell to make sure that Edward and Clarence are killed. A scene in the Tower shows the two young lads scared to death in their chamber awaiting their fate. Tyrell assigned Dighton and Forest to fulfil the killing and the two are shown entering the room of the princes. Even though they hesitate, they still murder both with daggers. Tyrell makes sure that everything goes well and the dead bodies are thrown into the river Thames on Richard’s demand. Cibber shows the tyrannical personality of King Richard, whereas Shakespeare does not present bloody deeds on stage.
The adaptation started with a scandal. The entire first act of the play was censored and consequently not performed on stage. However, this censorship only referred to the actual events on stage but not to the written text. The script of Richard III was fully printed and included all censored lines and words. The visualisation on stage was thought to create parallels to the actual life in England. The spectators might become deeply involved in the action on stage because of the contemporary costumes which made scenes look like real life. Furthermore, the showing of brutal scenes was feared to have a bewildering effect on the audience. Another reason for the censorship lies in the fear that the rewritten first act might show parallels to James II and may help to create sympathy for him. The political fear behind this accusation is very clear, but the idea that Cibber used the play to strengthen Jacobite ideas is far-fetched.
Cibber wrote in his work “An apology for the life of Colley Cibber” the following lines with regard to censorship:
The audience did not rise against the methods of the office of the Master of Revels. Society was used to accept that someone would decide on what they were allowed to see and what would better remain in the dark. The plot which was allowed to be staged may have been cut short by the Masters of Revels but at the same time the playwrights were able to at least publish their work and ensure a future recognition of their ideas and thoughts.
The prohibition to stage the play entirely caused a total failure of the play as well as a financial disaster for Drury Lane Theatre in the first years after the premier.
However, the adaptation did not suffer of being a failure for too long. Only about a decade later the play became a tremendous success.
The date of the first performance of Cibber’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of King Richard III is not known. But the Dedication of the play (dated February 1699/1700) and the Term Catalogues as well as advertisements, which all appeared in February and March 1699/1700, show that the latest possible month for the production would have been January 1700.
As Lincoln's Inn Fields was performing the play 1 Henry IV in December 1699, it is very likely that Cibber's The Tragical History of King Richard III was also performed in the last month of the year 1699 to offer an equivalent.
What is known for sure is the fact that Cibber's play was first staged at Drury Lane Theatre. After the première the play was staged again in February and March 1700 before its performance was discontinued. Cibber's play was not staged again for the next four years. It made its first reappearance on the stage in 1704 and had to wait again for another six years before being taken back into the performance circuit in 1710. It can be said that the play took at least 10 years to become established. The adaptation therefore did not suffer of being a failure for too long. Only a few years later the play became a huge success, which it remained for nearly two hundred years up to the nineteenth century. This is also reflected in the editions of this play published in the eighteenth century. After 1731 the play was frequently reprinted and published, which shows a huge demand and interest in this play. (For further details see Appendix A).
In between the years 1714 to 1749 it was at least performed for 170 times in different theatres. (Kavenik, 1995: 119) The quantity of performances rose even further after the year 1749. According to the author Kavenik, who concentrated on collecting information on Restoration Drama plays, Richard III was staged for 241 times between 1747 and 1779. This meant an immense increase.
Appendix B shows the huge increase of the number of performances of this play with the year 1710. The popularity of the play is also reflected by the presence of the Prince and Princess at the performance on 27 January 1715 in Drury Lane Theatre.
All performances referred to in Appendix B were based on Cibber's adaptation The Tragical History of Richard III. Nevertheless, different directors tried to return to the original version in the eighteen hundreds. Their attempts were granted with an outcry of society. Macready attempted to reintroduce more of the original text into the play in 1821 but was unsuccessful. The disappointment of the audience forced him to return to Cibber's more familiar version of the play. Twenty-three years later, Samuel Phelps launched a similar attempt at Sadler's Well; he was equally unsuccessful. The public opinion did not change until as late as the turn of the eighteenth century. Even then Samuel French stated Cibber's version of the play as the "acting version" of the plot.
Consequently, the fact that Cibber's adaptation was performed on stages up to the later half of the nineteenth century underlines this. (Owen, 2001: 282) Later in the century a movement back to the original Shakespearean version took place, which might be due to the people's arousing interest in original texts. From this point on Cibber's adaptation vanished from the stages and also from people's minds. This situation lasts up to today.
It took two centuries to change critical and audience opinion and to make a staging of the original script possible again. The once discredited original now rules the stage unchallenged. Cibber's version, which was the most oft-produced "Shakespeare" play in nineteenth century America, cannot be found on stage any longer. Some directors thought it a good idea to preserve some of Cibber's most famous lines, such as "Off with his head! So much for Buckingham.", (act four, last scene) which fit into the original version quite nicely.
During the middle of the eighteenth century the actor David Garrick began to establish himself at the London stages and later on became one of the most widely known actors for the role of Richard III in the year 1741. He was also portrayed in what later became his most famous role. The painting of David Garrick in the role of Richard III became one of the best known images of eighteenth century theatrical world.
Nevertheless, his career as an actor found its historic triumph at Goodman's Field on 19 October 1741, where the historical play The Life and Death of King Richard III was staged. The role of King Richard III is the one he was even portrayed in.
The artist William Hogarth portrayed the actor in 1746 as Mr. Garrick in the Character of Richard the 3rd [caption title]. [London]: Painted by Wm. Hogarth [&] Engraved by Wm. Hogarth & C[harles] Grignion, 1746. The original painting is slightly larger than 6 × 8 feet.
The painting shows the actor in his most famous scene (Act V, scene 3), the tent scene, in which King Richard is haunted by the ghosts of people he has killed on his proceeding to the throne. The night before the obliterate fight at Bosworth Field is presented on stage in a luxurious tent in which Richard tries to find some peace and quietness. Instead of resting he is haunted and not even his comfortable bed can change the situation. Richard cries out:
The painting has had an enormous impact on history painting ever since its creation. This influence has been reflected upon more than once.
Hogarth painted the picture in commission for Mr. Duncombe of Duncombe Park who paid the immense sum of £200 for the work. This scene from The tragical history of Richard III has become one of the most famous 18th-century dramatic images. In the same way that Garrick's performance marked an important step in the eighteenth-century revival of Shakespeare, so Hogarth's work represents a crucial development in the evolution of history painting during the period. Hogarth's portrayal, which draws on Le Brun's celebrated Family of Darius before Alexander the Great, shows the halting steps by both actors and artists to achieve an historically exact rendering of the past. Though such an accessory as armour, specially loaned from the Tower of London, is included in the left foreground, and Garrick is shown without his wig, his vaguely Elizabethan costume points to the relatively approximate sense of period which still dominated the British stage. Famed for his 'naturalistic' acting style, Garrick is displayed frozen with fear in a pose familiar from pictorial manuals on gesture and expression, a source widely used by Georgian actors to achieve appropriate dramatic effect. Midway between a theatrical portrait and an historical rendering of an episode from the nation's past, Hogarth's work offers insight into eighteenth-century actors' stagecraft. At the same time, it represents an important episode in the pictorial reconstruction of British history which so preoccupied both Hogarth's contemporaries and his successors (Welcome to William Hogarth’s Realm, 12.11.2006).
The painting helps to get a closer insight on the art of performance and creative work on stage during the time of the eighteenth century.
Edmund Kean (1787–1833) was another famous English actor who was celebrated for the role of Richard III. A frenetic and lively manner characterised Kean's style of performance. His tendency to drink too much alcohol before coming to work caused rumour and criticism. Nevertheless, the audience adored him for creating entertaining theatre. He mostly played villains such as Richard III. Moreover, Kean performed this role out of Britain. On 29 November 1820 he played Richard III in New York. (Theatre History Online – People Play UK, 03.01.07)
John Philip Kemble (1757–1823) played a large number of Shakespearian characters. Before he began to establish himself on the London stages he earned his living on the roads as a strolling actor, similar to the life his parents had led. In Hull he appeared for the first time as Macbeth on 30 September 1783. The picture above shows him in the role of Richard III. In contradiction to David Garrick, Kemble's style was a return to a rather motionless performance. Kemble dominated the London stage for three decades both as an actor and a manager. (Theatre History Online – People Play UK, 2 February 2007)
With putting the focus on selected aspects it was ensured to bring up an overview of Richard III. The staging of the adapted version from 1730 onwards shows that the playwrights as well as the audiences obviously found Shakespeare too long and exhausting. Shakespeare's style to hide scenes from the onlookers might have been another reason. The clearly stated copied lines of the original however show the linking of the two versions. Still, Cibber can be seen as the author of the adaptation as he gave the play his very own style. He created a version based on Shakespeare's words but clearly created an improvement as he focused on the main events of the play and created a more realistic art of performance. The original was apparently not flashy enough but the new version was cut short by censorship. This caused the first years of failing and made it hard on the play. The first act Cibber created was feared to arouse sympathy for King James II. King William, who reigned at the time of performance, may also have feared a generalisation of the play. The contemporary clothes worn on stage were thought to cause a close relationship to reality. The killing of a King on stage might have brought up suspicions about the death of the real King.

Winter-Telling Stories

Winter-Telling Stories is a collection of Kiowa tales written by Alice Marriott and illustrated by Roland Whitehorse.
Marriott relates a number of stories told her by George Hunt. The stories all relate to Saynday, the main character in the book, and his involvement with natural events on the southern plains. The title comes from Hunt's admonition to "always tell my stories in the winter, when the outdoors work is finished."

Olof Möller

Olof Möller (July 3, 1923, Riga – June 8, 1985, Solna) was a Swedish science fiction author. He was very productive, though most of what he wrote can be classified as pulp, and is considered the most productive science fiction writer in Sweden. For instance, he published 29 pocket books in the Jaktrymdskepp X12 ("Fighter Starship X12") series between 1974 and 1980.
He was born in Riga in Latvia, the son of medical practitioner and scientist Maximilian Möller and the German-born author Camilla Möller. The family fled to Sweden in 1939. He graduated in 1941 from the Stockholm Institute of Commerce, and obtained a number of varied employments and own enterprises in his civil career. From 1976 to 1985 he was responsible for educational literature at the Military Academy in Stockholm.

Chatham Grammar School for Boys

Chatham Grammar School for Boys (CGSB) is a grammar school with academy status in Chatham, Kent, England. It is a selective school; however, the sixth form is comprehensive.
The school’s history is believed to be from 1817, but its formal history began in 1913 with the establishment of Chatham Junior Technical School to train young men aged 13 – 16 for careers as artificers in the Royal Navy and in the Royal Dockyard School (later College) as engineers. The School evolved to become a centre of academic excellence as Chatham Grammar School for Boys, offering GCSE and A Levels as well as an Advanced Level Vocational Courses. The school moved to its current site in the 1920s, with its premises based around Holcombe Manor. After 1945 it became a specialist technical school (Chatham Technical School for Boys) and in 1982 it became a grammar school.
In September 2013 Ofsted delivered a report on their inspection carried out the previous June. The leadership and management were judged to be "inadequate" and as a result the school was placed in special measures. The previous report (2012) stated that the school was satisfactory, specifically because "students' achievement and the quality of teaching are not consistently good or better in all areas". English, in particular, was criticised as "although satisfactory, is slower than in other subjects". The 2013 report felt that the issues "have not been tackled effectively" and emphasised that the quality of teaching had not "improved quickly enough" Following a 2014 report the school has now been judged as being "Good" in all categories.
The pastoral structure of the school is based on three sections: Lower School (Years 7 and 8), Middle School (Years 9 and 10), and the Sixth Form (Years 11, 12 and 13).
The School Captain's Team consists of five members of the sixth form who serve in the roles of School Captain, Vice School Captain and Deputy School Captains from Easter of Year 12 until the following Easter of Year 13. There are also approximately 50 prefects led by the Head Prefect and two Deputy Head Prefects, along with several senior prefects.
There are four school houses, all are named after ships constructed at the historic Chatham Dockyard located nearby.
The houses compete against each other at events like the school's annual summer Sports Day, the autumn Cross Country, sports events such as rugby and hockey, and also at tasks like collecting the most merit marks, to obtain the House Shield trophy.
The school comprises several buildings, most notably the former Holcombe Manor. This was extended, replacing the conservatories, then expanded further with the construction of the atrium block, which currently houses the English faculty, opened in February 1997.
During the academic year 2001/2002 the school was extended out and up from the old Manor to facilitate English, Drama, Psychology and Music, as old mobile classrooms were removed from the site for refurbishment and a lease renewal.
In 2002 construction on a new Maths block ("M") began. The work was completed in August to be unveiled in the new academic year 2002/2003. This building houses one large first floor room used as an exam room and Sixth Form study area.
In December 2006 new accommodation for art students was finally ready and opened by local artist Billy Childish. Consisting of a Skylab-style structure, it was built on stilts above the existing design technology ("D") block, and includes a disabled lift, the first in the school.

2N2222

The 2N2222 is a common NPN bipolar junction transistor (BJT) used for general purpose low-power amplifying or switching applications. It is designed for low to medium current, low power, medium voltage, and can operate at moderately high speeds. It was originally made in the TO-18 metal can as shown in the picture.
The 2N2222 is considered a very common transistor, and is used as an exemplar of an NPN transistor. It is frequently used as a small-signal transistor, and it remains a small general purpose transistor of enduring popularity.
The 2N2222 was part of a family of devices described by Motorola at a 1962 IRE convention. Since then it has been made by many semiconductor companies, for example, Texas Instruments.
The JEDEC registration of a device number ensures particular rated values will be met by all parts offered under that number. JEDEC registered parameters include outline dimensions, small-signal current gain, transition frequency, maximum values for voltage withstand, current rating, power dissipation and temperature rating, and others, measured under standard test conditions. Other part numbers will have different parameters. The exact specifications depend on the manufacturer, case type, and variation. Therefore, it is important to refer to the datasheet for the exact part number and manufacturer.
All variations have a beta or current gain (hFE) of at least 100 in optimal conditions. It is used in a variety of analog amplification and switching applications.
NPN silicon transistors with similar properties are also made in a variety of small through-hole and surface mount packages including TO-92, SOT-23, and SOT-223.
Replacements for the 2N2222 are commonly available now in the cheaper TO-92 packaging, where it is known as the PN2222 or P2N2222, which has similar specifications except for the lower maximum collector current. The P2N2222 has a different order of pins than the metal case 2N2222, with its emitter and collector connections switched; other plastic-case transistors also have different pinouts.
Single transistors are also available in several different surface mount packages, and a number of manufacturers market surface mount packages that incorporate several 2N2222-type transistors in one package as an array of transistors. The general specifications of the various variants are similar, with the biggest difference being the maximum allowable current and power dissipation.
The BC548 is a low voltage, low current, general-purpose switching transistor in a TO-92 package.
The 2N2907 is an equally popular PNP transistor complementary to the 2N2222.
The 2N3904 is an NPN transistor that can only switch one-third the current of the 2N2222 but has otherwise similar characteristics. The 2N3904 exhibits its forward gain (beta) peak at a lower current than the 2N2222, and is useful in amplifier applications with reduced Ic, e.g., (gain peak at 10 mA for the 2N3904 but 150 mA for the 2N2222).
The 2N2219 is very similar with higher power dissipation rating.

Brandon Dubinsky

Brandon Grae Dubinsky (born April 29, 1986) is an American professional ice hockey player of Russian descent, an alternate captain for the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played in the NHL for the New York Rangers.
Dubinsky began playing youth hockey in Anchorage, and graduated from Service High School in 2004. He played his junior career with Portland Winter Hawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL) for four years, and was a two-time Western Conference second team All-Star before being drafted in the second round of the 2004 NHL Draft by the New York Rangers.
Dubinsky played for the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (AHL) for most of the 2006-2007 season. He first played for the New York Rangers on March 8, 2007, against the New York Islanders.
Dubinsky scored his first NHL goal against Marc-André Fleury on November 8, 2007, in a 4-2 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Dubinsky was the 3rd star of the game. Much of the season was spent centering the Rangers' first forward line with Jaromír Jágr and Sean Avery. He was one of sixteen rookies selected to participate in the 2008 YoungStars competition at the 56th NHL All-Star Game in Atlanta. He scored two goals and one assist and was named YoungStars Most Valuable Player. Dubinsky scored his first career playoff goal in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the New Jersey Devils on April 13, 2008.
His successful rookie season was marked on April 4, 2008, when Dubinsky was awarded the Steven McDonald Extra Effort Award for the 2007-08 season and "Rookie of the Year" for the Rangers as voted by his teammates.
On May 12, 2008, Dubinsky scored a hat trick in his first World Championships, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, against Norway. Team USA went on to win the game 9-1.
On November 24, 2008, Dubinsky scored a Gordie Howe hat trick against the Phoenix Coyotes. He squared off against the Coyotes' tough guy Daniel Carcillo protecting the Rangers' netminder Henrik Lundqvist at 2:58 into the first, taking a five-minute major penalty for fighting. He then scored a wraparound goal 1 minute 15 seconds into the second period (which ended up being the game winner). Dubinsky then finished the "Gordie" with an assist to Dan Girardi, who scored a power play goal from the blue line at 7:37 into the third period. The Rangers won the game 4-1 and Dubinsky along with Lundqvist and Zherdev were named the three stars. Ranger coach Tom Renney called the feat a "Gordie Orr hat trick" claiming that Dubinsky "didn't do that well in the fight".
Dubinsky finished his second full season with one point more than his previous season. Despite a strong start with a game-winning goal in the Rangers' first game and a streak of 11 points in his first 11 games in 2008-09, he suffered a 20-game goal-scoring drought. On April 15, 2009, Dubinsky scored the game-winning goal with 8:17 remaining in the third period of the Rangers' first game of the 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the Washington Capitals.
After holding out at the beginning of the 2009–10 season and missing over a week of training camp, Dubinsky signed a two-year contract worth $3.7 million as a restricted free agent. Dubinsky tallied 3 goals and 10 points on the season before suffering a broken hand in a game against the Calgary Flames on November 7, 2009, which relegated him to the injured reserved list for more than a month.
Dubinsky returned to the Rangers' lineup on December 14 against the Atlanta Thrashers. Four games later, he scored his first goal in more than two months against the Carolina Hurricanes. The goal was the game-winner in a 3-1 Rangers victory. Despite missing over a month due to injury, Dubinsky finished the season with career highs in goals and points. After the 2010-11 season, Dubinsky avoided arbitration with the Rangers and signed a four-year, $16.8 million contract.
On July 23, 2012, Dubinsky was traded, along with Artem Anisimov, Tim Erixon, and a first round draft pick in 2013, to the Columbus Blue Jackets for Rick Nash, minor leaguer Steven Delisle and a conditional third round pick in the same draft. On July 11, 2014, Dubinsky signed a 6-year, $35.1 million contract extension with Columbus. . Dubinsky was named an alternate captain of the Blue Jackets on October 8, 2015.
During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Dubinsky played for the Alaska Aces of the ECHL and made his Blue Jackets debut once the NHL returned from the work stoppage.
Dubinsky was born in Anchorage, Alaska. His father, mother, and two brothers live there.

Josiah Dent

Josiah Dent (1817–1899) was the third president of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, serving from 1879 to 1882.
Dent was born in Charles County, Maryland, in 1817. His father was an Episcopal priest who served in a Maryland regiment during the Revolutionary War. He became an attorney in the 1840s and set up a practice in St. Louis, Missouri. In the following decade, a cholera epidemic broke out in St. Louis, and Dent became a prominent relief worker and organizer. He remained in St. Louis until 1861, when the Civil War began, at which time he moved to Washington, D.C. Dent never argued law in the D.C. courts, but had a thriving wartime practice as the custodian of absentee properties: because his strong sympathies for the Democratic Party were well known, Washington and District residents who joined the Confederacy would leave their property in his care to maintain and protect from government confiscation.
After the Civil War, Dent became the president of the board of directors of Linthicum Institute, an educational institution founded by a bequest of $50,000 in the will of Dent's father-in-law Edward M. Linthicum (a prominent socialite and philanthropist in Georgetown). The institute was an alternative educational institution for young men who could not otherwise afford college. It became host over its existence to hundreds of male students, making Dent's reputation as a deeply committed educator.
Dent was, in 1874, a member of the Congressionally mandated committee that recommended the disposal of the territorial government and the formulation of a three-member board of commissioners (one Democrat, one Republican, and one nonaffiliated planning engineer) for the District of Columbia. In July 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Dent as the Democratic commissioner on that board.
Dent became president of the board in the following year, after the resignation of Seth Ledyard Phelps, serving until July 1882. During his term as board president, Dent was noted for improving the relations between the capital city and the U.S. Treasury. After his term as commissioner expired, Dent lived in Georgetown until 1889, when he married his second wife and moved to Berkeley Springs, West Virginia where he died in 1899. He was buried in Washington's Oak Hill Cemetery.

Gene Wooten

Gene Wooten (born June 5, 1953 in Franklinton, NC, died November 7, 2001 in Nashville, TN) was an American dobro player and multi-instrumentalist.
Wooten became serious about playing music professionally while a student at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC, and ultimately moved to Nashville, TN in 1977, where he landed his first professional job as a musician with Wilma Lee Cooper. He fast became a regular on the Grand Ole Opry. His work as a dobro player took him on the road and in the studio with numerous well known Bluegrass stars including the Osborne Brothers and Del and Ronnie McCoury. In 1994 he shared a Grammy Award with Jerry Douglas, Josh Graves, Rob Ickes, and others for his work on the all-star dobro album called The Great Dobro Sessions. He was also known as a member of the Country Gazette, and the Sidemen which were the house band of musicians at the famous Station Inn in Nashville, TN, a coveted position he held for more than ten years. For three years, he was named dobro player of the year by the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass in America. He recorded one solo album. Late in his career he was best known for playing on Patty Loveless' award winning acoustic album, Mountain Soul.
Wooten’s craftsmanship with wooden instruments of all kinds impressed his peers. He worked for various musical instrument manufacturers, repairing instruments for some of the world’s most famous Bluegrass musicians. He was especially appreciated for his ability to work on the dobro.

2N2907

The 2N2907 is a commonly available PNP bipolar junction transistor used for general purpose low-power amplifying or switching applications. It is designed for low to medium current, low power, medium voltage, and can operate at moderately high speeds. This transistor was made by several manufacturers; Texas Instruments released a data sheet for their version of this part dated March 1973. An "A" suffix indicates a slightly higher breakdown voltage. These transistors have an enduring popularity with electronics hobbyists.
It is a 0.6-ampere, 60-volt, 400-milliwatt transistor. For the 2N2907, the gain–bandwidth product under specified test conditions, or , is 200 Megahertz, which is notionally the frequency at which the current gain drops to one. Practical use of a transistor requires that it be used for frequencies much less than . At low frequencies, the current gain (beta) is at least 100. The 2N2907 is used in a variety of analog amplification and switching applications.
The 2N2222 is an NPN transistor complementary to the 2N2907.

<doc id="9366611" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9366611" title="Recovery swap">
Recovery swap

In finance, recovery swaps, recovery locks, or recovery default swaps (RDS) are derivative contracts related to credit default swaps, and reference a bond issuance as its underlying. They are designed to provide a hedge against the uncertainty of recovery in default.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association does not keep records on the size of the recovery swap market because there has not yet been sufficient member demand.
A recovery swap is an agreement between two parties to swap a real recovery rate (whenever it is ascertained) with a fixed recovery rate that can be locked in today. The parties are speculating on whether a company that is no longer liquid will pay out more or less than a certain percentage for each bond. The reference price is set to the fixed recovery rate rather than 100, chosen such that the RDS prices at zero on issue. Since the swap is issued at a price of zero, if the reference entity does not default in the term of the swap, then the swap expires with no cashflows having taken place.
Because the swap only has value (to either counterparty) during a default, the main market in RDS involves bonds that pose a high risk of default, when the reference entity (company) is in financial difficulty.
A related instrument is a fixed recovery CDS. In theory an RDS protection (receive fixed recovery) can be approximated by buying protection with fixed CDS (binary CDS) and selling the ordinary CDS (writing protection). In reality there may be a slight difference in the terms of the swaps, particularly relating to settlement. It is usually the case that fixed recovery CDS are settled immediately, since there is no need to wait for recovery to be determined, whereas a recovery swap will wait until the ordinary CDS is settled before paying out.

Hyacinthe Sigismond Gerdil

Hyacinthe Sigismond Gerdil, C.R.S.P. (20 June 1718 – 12 August 1802) was an Italian theologian, bishop and cardinal, who was a significant figure in the response of the papacy to the assault on the Catholic Church by the upheavals caused by the French Revolution.
Gerdil was born in 1718 at Samoëns in the Duchy of Savoy to Pierre Gerdil, a notary, and Françoise Perrier, a native of Taninges. When 15 years old, he joined the Barnabites at Annecy, and was sent to Bologna to pursue his theological studies; also having an interest in the sciences, he devoted his mind to the various branches of knowledge with great success. While he improved his command of Italian, he came the attention of Propero Lambertini, Archbishop of Bologna, later Pope Benedict XIV, who used the young seminarian in his own study of French texts.
After Gerdil had completed his initial studies in 1738, he was assigned to teach philosophy at the Barnabite college in Macerata, then the same at the school at Casale Monferrato (1739-1748). During this period, in 1741, he was ordained to the priesthood. By 1749, the range and quality of his writings led to his induction by various scientific and literary societies across Europe, ranging from the Bologna Institute of Sciences and the Royal Society of London to the Accademia degli Arcadi in Rome. That same year he was appointed as professor of philosophy at the University of Turin, transferring to the teach of moral theology in 1754.
In 1758, upon the recommendation of Pope Benedict XIV, Gerdil was chosen as the tutor of the Prince of Piedmont, afterwards King Charles Emmanuel IV. He left his teaching position at the university the following year to deal with his other responsibilities in the Church. In 1764 he was elected the Provincial Superior of the Barnabites in Savoy and the Piedmont. In 1768 he was chosen as the tutor of the sons of his previous student, now the King of Sardinia..
Gerdil was designated a "cardinal in petto" in 1773 by Pope Clement XIV, but that pope died before his appointment could be made public. He was appointed as a consultor to the Holy Office in 1776 by Pope Pius VI, moving to Rome, where he took a residence next to the General Motherhouse of the Barnabite Order at the Church of San Carlo ai Catinari. The King of Sardinia named him the commendatory abbot of the Abbey of San Michele della Chiusa in January 1777. He carried out his supervision of the distant abbey from Rome through correspondence, devoting much of the benefice he gained to the help of the poor.
In March of that same year, Gerdil was appointed the bishop of the titular see of Dibona, and was consecrated at the Barnabite church by the Vicar General of Rome. The following June he again named a "cardinal in petto" by Pope Paul, receiving the red hat on 18 December 1777 and the titular church of San Giovanni a Porta Latina on 30 March 1778. The pope also appointed him to various congregations of the Roman Curia, including that of Prefect of the Propaganda Fide.
Gerdil changed his title to that of the Basilica of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. He served briefly as the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church (1786-1787).
Gerdil was member of the committee of cardinals which examined and refined the text of the response against the "Puntuazione di Ems", issued by the archbishops of Germany in which they defied papal authority. From 1790 to 1794, he was member of the committee which prepared the final draft of the papal bull, "Auctorem fidei" (28 August 1794), which condemned the propositions of the Synod of Pistoia, a similar stand by the bishops of Tuscany. During those four years, he was also president of the particular congregation charged with the preparation of the papal documents which condemned the French Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the Civic Oath imposed to the French clergy in 1798, and other acts imposed on the Church by Revolutionary France.
After the invasion of Rome by the French Revolutionary Army in February 1798 the pope fled to Siena, while Gerdil fled to his Abbey of San Michele. After the death of Pope Pius in 1799, he would likely have been elected pope at the conclave of Venice in 1800, had not his election been vetoed by Cardinal Franziskus Herzan von Harras, in the name of Francis II, the last Holy Roman Emperor.
After the conclave accompanied the new pope, Pius VII, to Rome, where he resumed his posts in the Curia, still being fit and active, despite being past the age of 80. After a brief illness, he died at the Barnabite motherhouse, and was buried in their. Church of San Carlo.
Gerdil's numerous works written in Latin, Italian, and French on divers subjects — dogmatic and moral theology, canon law, philosophy, pedagogy, history, physical and natural sciences, etc. — form twenty volumes in quarto (ed. Rome, 1806–1821). Among the most important may be mentioned: "L'Immortalité de l'âme démontrée contre Locke et défense du P. Malebranche contre ce philosophe" (Turin, 1747–48), 2 vols.; "Réflexions sur la théorie et la pratique de l'éducation contre les principes de J.-J. Rousseau" (Turin, 1765), reprinted in a new edition under the title "Anti-Emile"; "Exposition des caractères de la vraie religion", written in Italian (translated into French, Paris, 1770), etc.
Gerdil's works were written especially for the defence of spiritual philosophy against materialism, of supernatural religion against Deism, of the supreme authority of the pope against Febronianism and the Synod of Pistoia.

2N3906

The 2N3906 is a commonly used PNP bipolar junction transistor intended for general purpose low-power amplifying or switching applications. It is designed for low electric current and power and medium voltage, and can operate at moderately high speeds.
The 2N3906 is manufactured in a plastic TO-92 case. When looking at the flat side with the leads pointed downward, the three leads emerging from the transistor are, from left to right, the emitter, base, and collector leads.
The 2N3906 is specified by a collector current of 200 mA, collector-base and collector-emitter voltages of 40 V, for power dissipation of 300 mW. Its current gain bandwidth product F is 250 MHz, with a beta of at least 100.
The complementary NPN transistor to the 2N3906 is the 2N3904. Both types were registered by Motorola Semiconductor in the mid-1960s.

Little Man, What Now? (song)

"Little Man, What Now?" is a song performed by Morrissey on his album "Viva Hate".
A reference to Morrissey's love of 1960s kitchen sink drama, the song details the fall of a minor celebrity from a TV star in the 1960s to an unknown in the 1970s. With the title originating from the 1932 book, "Kleiner Mann, was nun?" ("Little Man, What Now?") by Hans Fallada, based upon German social problems and lyric themes borrowed from the old Judy Garland song "I'm Just an In-Between", about being at once too young and too old.
There are contrasting theories of who the "little man" of the title is, with the two most common names mentioned being Roger Tonge of "Crossroads" and Jack Wild who appeared as the Artful Dodger in the musical film, "Oliver!", and later on ATV's "Look Familiar".
However, more recent opinion has swung towards the actual subject being actor Malcolm McFee (d. 2001, Braintree, Essex) who, unlike Wild or Tong, did star in the song's cited ATV series that ran for four seasons ("Please Sir!"} which was followed by the sequel series "The Fenn Street Gang") and did largely disappear from public view after this initial run of TV success.
The subject may also be Jimmy Clitheroe a diminutive comic actor that specialised in being cast as a young boy until very late in his career. According to Alan Bennett, Morrissey was "fascinated by this figure."
The song was performed live by Morrissey on his 2002 and 2004 tours.

Bobby Jaspar (20 February 1926 – 28 February 1963) was a Belgian cool jazz and hard bop saxophonist, flautist and composer.
Born in Liège, Belgium, Jaspar learned to play piano and clarinet at a very young age. Later, he took up the tenor saxophone and flute.
With the "Bop Shots" band, he took his first steps in the jazz world. In 1950, Jaspar moved to Paris, playing and recording with the best musicians of the era. Here he met his future wife, Blossom Dearie.
In 1956, Jaspar was persuaded to try his luck in the United States, where his reputation in jazz circles had preceded him. He played and recorded with the quintet of J. J. Johnson, with Kenny Burrell, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Donald Byrd and many others.
In 1961/1962, Jaspar returned to Europe for a year for a series of concerts and a number of recordings. With his colleague, Belgian guitarist René Thomas, he formed a successful quintet. In some sessions, this was expanded to a powerful sextet with American trumpeter Chet Baker. One of those sessions was immortalised on the record "Chet Is Back", recorded in 1962.
Bobby Jaspar died from a heart attack in New York City on 28 February 1963 at age 37.

Callose

Callose is a plant polysaccharide. It is composed of glucose residues linked together through β-1,3-linkages, and is termed a β-glucan. It is thought to be manufactured at the cell wall by callose synthases and is degraded by β-1,3-glucanases. It is laid down at plasmodesmata, at the cell plate during cytokinesis and during pollen development. It is produced in response to wounding, infection by pathogens., aluminium and abscisic acid. Deposits often appear on the sieve plates at the end of the growing season. Callose also forms immediately around the developing meiocytes and tetrads of sexually reproducing angiosperms but is not found in related apomictic taxa. Callose deposition at the cell wall has been suggested as an early marker for direct somatic embryogenesis from cortical and epidermal cells of "Cichorium" hybrids.

Girlguiding BGIFC (British Guides in Foreign Countries) is part of Girlguiding UK and is for British nationals living overseas. Administratively it is based in Commonwealth Guide Headquarters in Victoria, London. Members in this section of Girlguiding UK follow the normal programme very closely. Girls make the same promise as girls in the UK. In 2007, Girlguiding BGIFC had 3697 members, including adults and the Commissioner was Ruth Sara.
In 2004, Girlguiding BGIFC had groups in 31 countries, in places such as Prague, Dubai and Riyadh.
Girlguiding BGIFC also supports Lone Guiding. If a British girl living abroad wishes to be a member of Girlguiding UK at any age level and has no group, then she may become a lone guide. Girlguiding BGIFC's lone guides interact by post and email and are encouraged to attend the biennial camps.
All Girlguiding BGIFC members wear the galleon badge on their uniform. The badge depicts a galleon sailing across the ocean. The colours of the Union Flag, red, white and blue, are all present. The ship symbolises Guiding overseas. The red cross on the white mainsail is a crusader cross, symbolising the adventurous and crusading spirit of the people who leave their home country to live and work abroad.
Originally the metal Galleon badges were hand-painted, with the country's name displayed on a scroll beneath the blue waves of the sea. Later, as BGIFC spread, individual hand painting was no longer possible and the galleon badges became mass-produced.
Girlguiding BGIFC traces its origins back to the 1st Peninsular Guide Company in Porto, Portugal. This company started in 1911, but was not registered until 1913. The majority of Units have been registered since 1950, although many go back much further than this. The first Lone Unit was formed in 1985. On 1 April 1986, BGIFC was established as a Region of Girlguiding UK (now Girlguiding), similar to the nine UK Countries and Regions. This move gave BGIFC its own Commissioner, Advisers and Secretary.
Girlguiding BGIFC runs a biennial camp in the UK.
Girlguiding BGIFC has three Counties: Benelux and France, Cyprus and Germany. Not all Units are organised into one of these Counties.
There are seven districts in the Benelux and France county, but not all Units are in one of these districts.
There are three districts in the Cyprus County, based around RAF Akrotiri, Episkopi Army Garrison and Nicosia. Each district has its own District Commissioner. The British Armed Forces community provides the majority of girls, but Leaders are often from the expatriate community.
In 2007, Germany had 4 Divisions, 12 Districts, 1 Senior Section, 15 Guide Units, 22 Brownie units and 18 Rainbow units, ranging from Hamburg to Munich.

A main road town is town with a small population and it usually have one or two roads usable by motorized transport. These towns are found generally on sides of National Highway or important roads within states of India. These are called towns due to their having a higher population than villages. These towns may be taluk headquarters or headquarters of a subdivision. These town act as transit point for several villages nearby.
Such towns may have better basic amenities compared to typical villages in India. Amenities may include a post office, bank, tea stall, a few shops, etc. They are connected with telephone and electricity services. There may be a doctor or small dispensary in these towns. These towns act as a centre for buying and selling of goods or produce from nearby villagers. They are sometimes resting places for truck drivers and other motorists after a long drive.

Raymond P. Hammond

Raymond P. Hammond is an American poet, critic and editor of the "New York Quarterly" magazine since assuming control after the death of William M. Packard in 2002.
Hammond was born August 31, 1964 in Roanoke, Virginia. Packard had "willed" the magazine by asking Hammond in writing to take control of the magazine should anything happen to him.
Hammond is the author of "Poetic Amusement". Originally written in 2000 as his Master's thesis, "Poetic Amusement" was passed around underground as a digital file for ten years among those associated with the "New York Quarterly". What began as Hammond's observations of the influence of "po' biz" and writing programs on contemporary American poetry became a timeless treatise on poetry itself. Using his experience with NYQ and devouring many literary critics across the ages from the ancient Greeks to contemporary critics, Hammond examines at once both our current literary environment and the essence of poetry. In seeking to answer the questions "What is poetry?" and "Where does poetry come from?" for himself, he encourages readers to ask those questions for and of themselves as well.

I am an employee of Angie's List and have identified myself as such on my user page as well as the Angie's List Talk page. The Angie's List article came to my attention in January when someone from outside the company pointed it out to me after noticing there were some negative and inaccurate claims on the page. Before doing anything I registered as a user and I contacted ONUnicorn who had made previous edits to seek advice. ONUnicorn took out some of the negative, unsourced information (I did not ask her to do this). I made a few edits to get corrected and updated information on the page. 24.163.255.34 thought it sounded like an advertisement and reverted it back to the version before ONUnicorn's edits which included a correction of the logo. ONUnicorn requested a peer review of the article around this time. At that point I decided to take myself out of the editing since even though I tried to remain neutral, I may have been showing some bias. I also sent an email to Wikipedia that was answered by Jeandre du Toit, because I thought that some of the statements may be considered libel and that Wikipedia might be able to or want to do something about it. He suggested I contribute to the talk page and email Brad Patrick for further help. Brad also just recommended making my points on the talk page. I then took my suggestions to the Talk page. The article has gone back and forth ever since. 24.163.255.34 added a section about financial and membership information that is entirely unsourced and pure speculation. Others have tried discussing with him/her the inclusion of this unsourced information and speculation. He/she continued to revert and edit without taking advice and suggestion of others. 24.163.255.34 claims that the "ignore all rules" policy applies in this case. The article is now protected from editing.
It's probably pretty obvious that I'm not too familiar with Wikipedia and I need advice on how to proceed. I'm not sure what my level of involvement should be since I am affiliated with Angie's List, but I would like to help in coming to an agreeable resolution. I am not happy with the current state of the article and I don't believe that it is npov (bias aside). Obviously it's bad for our company to have these negative statements/accusations on Wikipedia but I also want to avoid turning it into an advertisement because I know that is not what Wikipedia is for.
If you need more detail please let me know. Also, I apologize that I didn't link more in the summary but I couldn't figure out the proper way to do it.

Year of Wonders

Year of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague is a 2001 international bestselling historical fiction novel by Geraldine Brooks. It was chosen as both a "New York Times" and "Washington Post" Notable Book.
The novel is written in the point of view of a housemaid named Anna Frith, on what she lives through when the plague hits her village. It is based on the history of the small Derbyshire village of Eyam that, when beset upon by the plague in 1666, quarantines itself in order to prevent the disease from spreading further. The Plague that hit Eyam is historically similar to the Black Plague in Europe.
The novel opens in the spring of 1665 when a young widow Anna Frith, takes on a tailor, George Remington Viccars as a boarder. Shortly after the arrival of a box of fabrics from London, Mr. Viccars develops a high fever, and starts exhibiting symptoms of the bubonic plague. He begs her to burn all he brought with him to stop the spread of contagion, but after his death, Mr. Viccars' clients come to claim their work and disregard the warning.
Over the next few weeks, Anna’s neighbor (Mr. Viccar’s employer), her two young sons, and a few other villagers fall ill with the plague and die. The spate of deaths is blamed on a widow, Mem Gowdie and her niece, Anys Gowdie, the village's herbalists and midwives, who are accused of being witches. Both Mem and Anys are murdered by villagers.
The Rector Mr. Michael Mompellion proposes that the villagers quarantine themselves to avoid spreading the “plague-seeds” beyond the village. With the exception of the Bradfords, the local landed gentry, the whole village agrees.
Over the following months, Anna and the rector's wife Elinor attempt to learn the uses of the contents of the Gowdies' physick garden, and take up the roles of village midwives. Anna and Elinor develop a strong bond through their trials, the relationship becoming one of friends and equals instead of a servant and her mistress. They support each other through their struggles, and Elinor confesses as to why a high-born woman such as herself married a humble rector and devoted her life to helping the less fortunate. Meanwhile, as Elinor and Anna take care of the needs of the living, Mompellion struggles to keep up with the spiritual needs of the dying.
After the sexton dies of heart failure from digging so many graves, Anna persuades her father, Josiah Bont, to take up the work of gravedigging, but her plan backfires when the greedy drunkard takes to robbing the estates of the dead. Finally, the villagers hold a Barmote Court, where he is left to die or be saved by his wife, Aphra. But no one comes to save him.
Aphra, already superstitious, quickly descends into complete madness upon the death of all of her children from plague and is discovered selling bogus charms and spells against the plague for extortionate prices. She does this by pretending to be the ghost of the deceased Anys Gowdie. The villagers punish her by casting her into a disused well that now serves as a manure pit, in which she nearly drowns. She is completely incoherent and in a catatonic state by the time she is brought out in the morning, and the rector postpones dealing with her crimes fully until the plague is over.
As no more are stricken with the Plague, the remaining villagers become secure in the fact that the Plague is truly gone from their village. Mompellion chooses to hold a service of Thanksgiving for their deliverance. However, the service has barely begun when a deranged Aphra, clutching the corpse of her youngest child, attacks the congregation, fatally slicing Elinor’s neck before turning the knife on herself.
Mompellion succumbs wholly to grief and the total loss of his faith in God. Without their rector to guide them, the villagers also descends into ennui, too traumatized after so many months of death and suffering.
As Anna discovers a will to live in spite of the ordeal, she seeks to comfort Mompellion, and they are drawn together in equal desire and desperation for each other. After they make love, Mompellion confesses his own dark secret regarding his relationship with Elinor (He admits to never having sexual relations with his wife because of a sin she committed earlier in life), and Anna is repulsed. She flees, and finds the newly returned Elizabeth Bradford, who confesses that her mother is in labour with a bastard child and sure to die. Anna goes with Elizabeth and is able to safely deliver the baby. As the Colonel would not permit the bastard child to live, Anna offers to take the child and leave the village permanently.
In the epilogue, she briefly narrates the three years since she left Eyam. Her flight from the Bradford’s wrath leads her to board the next ship leaving the port of Plymouth, taking her and the child to Oran. Upon her arrival, she seeks out a Muslim doctor, having found physick and midwifery to be her vocation. He agrees to take her in, due to his despair at Sex segregation in Islam keeping women and their husbands from seeking his aid during medical emergencies and labour. To satisfy the customs of the Al-Andalus Arabs, he takes her as one of his wives in name only so that she may continue her study and work with him freely. The book closes with her taking her two daughters by the hand before going into the city – the Bradford child, who is now named A'isha, for the sustainment she gave Anna during their sea voyage to Oran, and her birth daughter, conceived with Michael Mompellion, whom she has named Elinor.
Shaunagh O’Conner describes the novel as “quirky, stranger-than-fiction tales from history,” and praising its use of “fascinating details of life in the 1600s." Laura D. Shumar compared "Year of Wonders" to "Albert Camus's "La Peste" (1947; "The Plague", 1948)." In an interview with the author, Noah Adams called it "heartbreaking." Shumar also stated that "Anna was not a person but a perfect character." Courier Mail agreed, saying, "we glimpse an independent modern woman than an unconvent 17th-century girl." Laurence Mazzeno of Magill Book Reviews praises it as "Exceptionally well researched and deftly crafted".
The Australian named the themes of "witchcraft, madness, and repressed sexuality."
The book also has the themes of strength, woman's power, religion and trust.

Newport by-election, 1956

The Newport by-election, 1956 was a parliamentary by-election held on 6 July 1956 for the British House of Commons constituency of Newport in Monmouthshire.
The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Labour Member of Parliament (MP), Peter Freeman had died on 19 May 1956, aged 67. He had held the seat since the 1945 general election, having previously been MP for Brecon and Radnorshire from 1929 to 1931.
The Labour candidate was Sir Frank Soskice, who had been Solicitor General and then Attorney General in the Labour Government 1945-1951. His Sheffield Neepsend constituency had been abolished for the 1955 general election.
The Conservative Party selected as its candidate Donald Box, a stockbroker from Cardiff who had contested the seat at the 1955 general election. The Liberal Party did not field a candidate, and third candidate was Emrys Roberts of Plaid Cymru.
Soskice held the seat with a majority higher than that achieved by Freeman the previous year. He held the seat until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1966 general election, having been Home Secretary from 1964–1965.
Box was elected at the 1959 general election in Cardiff North, and held that seat until 1966.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (soundtrack)

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the soundtrack to Steven Spielberg's 1989 film of the same name. It was released by Wea in 1989. The music was composed and conducted by John Williams, and performed by a studio orchestra.
The official album only contains key moments from the film's score and is out of print. The expanded edition was officially released by Concord Music Group in a box set with the soundtracks of the other "Indiana Jones" films on November 11, 2008. Williams' arrangement of the Königgrätzer Marsch, the German military march that is played during the Berlin book burning scene, does not appear on the soundtrack.
Tracks do not appear in the order that they occur in the film, but instead in a succession chosen by Williams for listening purposes. Listeners interested in hearing the selections in score order may program the album thus: 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 7, 13.
"Keeping up With The Joneses" was dialed out in the film and replaced by an alternate cue, although segments derived from this track do appear in the film. This first plays after the book-burning scene, while Henry Jones reads a newspaper at the airport that conceals his face. The music that is playing at the time is the "Keeping up With The Joneses" theme, which is played rather softly on the woodwinds. The second segment plays during the beach scene, as the Joneses run down the beach.

HPD series of mines

The HPD-1, HPD-2 and HPD-3 are a series of French electrically fuzed anti-tank landmines that use Misznay Schardin effect warheads. The entire series of mines conform to the United States MIL-STD-331.
The HPD-1 consists of a large case with a prominent circular section at one end that contains the clearing charge and Misznay Schardin effect warhead, and a rectangular section that contains the batteries and seismic and magnetic sensors that the electronic fuze uses. It was developed to be laid automatically from the Matenin minelayer or by hand.
When the seismic sensor detects a suitable target the magnetic sensor is then monitored, when a vehicle with a mass of more than eight tons passes over the mine, triggering the magnetic sensor the mines warhead is triggered. First the mine detonates a clearing charge, which removes any earth that may have been laid over the mine, then it triggers the Misznay Schardin effect charge, which projects a slug of metal upwards. In testing the mine penetrated up to 100 millimeters of armour, although it can official penetrate only 70 millimeters.
The HPD-2 is a development of the HPD-1 mine. It incorporates a series of enhancements to both the warhead and fuzing mechanism. The mine's warhead is said to be a "second generation" Misznay Schardin effect design capable of penetrating up to 150 millimeters of armour. In addition it can be laid in up to one and half meters of water.
The mine arms itself after an initial delay of ten minutes and self-neutralizes after 30 days. It also incorporates an anti-handling device, which is sensitive to motion and the signals produced by mine detectors.
As of 2006, approximately 400,000 HPD-2 series mines have been ordered. The mine is in service with the French Army, and is sold to the Belgian and Norwegian armed forces. It is in licence production in Switzerland for the Swiss Army as "Panzerabwehrmine 88" (Pzaw Mi 88).
The HPD-3 is a further development of the HPD-2 featuring a programmable fuze. It has a three pin interface for a programming device. It can be set for an active period of either 30 days after which it self-neutralizes or for a shorter active period of between four and ninety six hours after which it self-destructs.

Bob Giraldi

Bob Giraldi (born January 17, 1939) is an American film and television director known for directing the film "Dinner Rush" and the music video for Michael Jackson's song "Beat It." His work has garnered many accolades, including several London International Awards, Cannes Advertising Awards, NY International Awards, Addy Awards, Chicago Film Festival Awards and hundreds of Clio Awards. He has also been named one of the "101 Stars Behind 100 Years of Advertising."
Giraldi was born in Paterson, New Jersey, to a working-class Italian-American family. He attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York on a basketball and baseball scholarship, graduating in 1960 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.
Upon graduation, in 1960, he worked as a graphic designer at General Motors in Detroit. Shortly thereafter he returned to New York, where he spent the next nine years as an art director and creative supervisor at the advertising agency Young & Rubicam.
1965, he began teaching advertising at The School of Visual Arts in New York, and soon became the Chair of the Advertising Department. In 1968, Silas Rhodes appointed him the Assistant Director of the School. During the Vietnam War, the School was forced to make administrative changes, and Giraldi had to step down. However, he remained on the School's Board of Directors, and in 1981, directed and produced a film, "Burnt Umber", featuring a then-unknown actor Denzel Washington, for SVA's recruitment program.
In 1970, Giraldi became creative director of the advertising agency DellaFemina & Partners, and three years later formed his production company Giraldi Productions, which has to-date produced and directed close to 3000 commercials, music videos and short films.
Giraldi's advertising campaigns include the Pepsi-Cola campaign with Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, memorable for an incident in which Jackson's hair caught on fire in an accident involving pyrotechnics on the set, and commercials for the Miller Brewing Company commercials that featured such celebrities as Rodney Dangerfield, Bob Uecker, Billy Martin, John Madden, Bubba Smith, Tommy Heinsohn, Mickey Spillane, Dick Butkus and Joe Piscopo. He was also responsible for commercials for the Broadway shows "A Chorus Line", "Evita", "Dreamgirls", "Sophisticated Ladies", "Sunset Boulevard", "The Phantom of the Opera" and "The Full Monty".
According to Captain Don Donester, the fire safety inspector, who was on the set during filming of the commercial, overheard Giraldi informing Michael Jackson to "Stand there longer [under the sparks]. You'll look more majestic." In a response to TMZ, Giraldi countered that he had no idea putting Michael directly underneath the sparks was dangerous, and furthermore, it was the responsibility of fire safety officials such as Donester to warn him of any risk. He also stated that there were never supposed to be sparks; in fact, the fireworks malfunctioned.
Giraldi's first music video as director was 1983's "Pieces of Ice", by Diana Ross. He would direct several Ross videos during the rest of the decade. Giraldi wrote and directed the music video for "Beat It" starring Michael Jackson. Arguably Giraldi's best-known work, the video won an American Music Award, the Billboard Music Award, a 1984 People's Choice Award, and is included in "Rolling Stone"'s top ten examples of video art at The Museum of Modern Art in New York.
Other famous videos followed. "Say, Say, Say", with Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney, won the 1984 Le Festival du Clip St. Tropez. "Love Is a Battlefield", with Pat Benatar won a 1984 MTV Video Music Award, and "Hello" with Lionel Richie, won a 1985 American Music Award. Other notable music videos from the 1980s include: "Running with the Night" by Lionel Richie, "Possession Obsession" by Daryl Hall & John Oates. He directed the video for Jean Michel Jarre's Rendez-vous Houston concert. He also directed the video for the Will Smith song, "Just The Two Of Us".
Giraldi made his feature film directing debut with the film "Hiding Out" (1987), starring Jon Cryer. His next feature film "Dinner Rush" (2000) appeared on a number of 2001's Top 10 lists, including Salon.com's and Richard Roeper's of Ebert & Roeper and was selected for the New Directors/New Films Festival presented by The Film Society of Lincoln Center at MoMA. Giraldi's independent films have also garnered numerous awards and have found their way into collections as diverse as the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. In 1991, Giraldi was inducted into the Art Director's Hall of Fame, one of the few film directors to be honored. His short film "The Routine" premiered at Sundance Film Festival and won Best Drama at the 6th Annual Los Angeles International Short Film Festival. Another short, "My Hometown", is now in the National Baseball Hall of Fame's permanent collection, and "Dream Begins", an integral part of New York's national Olympic bid, now resides with the Museum of Modern Art. Giraldi's short film, "Honey Trap" starring Debbie Harry, won a Gold Remi Award at the 39th Annual WorldFest Houston and screened at Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films, San Diego Film Festival, Raindance in the UK, and Hamptons International Film Festival. , his latest short film, has won numerous awards, including the Fresno Reel Pride 2008 Audience Award; 27 Reeling: Chicago Lesbian & Gay Film Festival Jury Award; 14th Annual Palm Springs International Festival of Films Official Selection; 33rd Cleveland International Film Festival, Best LGBT Short Film.
In the early '90's, Giraldi threw his hat into the New York restaurant ring, opening Jo-Jo with Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Giraldi then helped start the Jean Georges 4-star namesake restaurant as well as Vong and its London and Hong Kong outposts. Gerald was also involved in Patria, which received the New York Times 3 Stars, but has since closed.In 2002 Bob joined forces with restaurateur Luigi Comandatore creator of Bread Nolita and, opened the Tuscan fare eatery BREADTribecat that earned 2 Stars from The Times. Another establishment, Diablo Royale, has become a popular taqueria in the West Village and currently is in the process of opening another location in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In March 2009, Giraldi opened Tonda, a pizzeria whose focus is healthy, casual fare inspired by a Napoli cuisine.
In 1995, Giraldi and Patti Greaney created the original website StarChefs.com, featuring celebrity chefs and cookbook authors. StarChefs continues to be the foremost website used by professionals and food afficiandos. In addition to StarChefs, Giraldi has begun negotiations with several Japanese high profile corporations to create ChefRising.com, a new culinary, food-centric website in that country featuring the latest news and information about Japan's emerging star chefs and food community.

James Barker Edmonds

James Barker Edmonds (May 20, 1832 – December 29, 1900) was president of the board of commissioners for the District of Columbia, USA, from 1883 to 1886.
Edmonds was born in Saratoga County, New York. He began the study of the law early, and was only 21 when he was admitted to the New York State bar in 1853 and entered practice. Three years later, in 1856, Edmonds relocated to Iowa City, Iowa, then the capital of the state, where he opened a law partnership with Charles T. Ransom and grew the firm into one of the most prestigious and wealthy in the Midwest.
Edmonds successfully practiced law in Iowa for 19 years, but in 1875 his poor health force him to relocate to Washington, D.C., where he settled into a retirement from the legal practice but remained a sought-after consultant for other attorneys in the city.
Although he remained the board's Republican commissioner until 1885, when former Louisiana Senator Joseph Rodman West resigned from the presidency of the D.C. Board of Commissioners in 1883, President Chester A. Arthur nominated Edmonds to serve as the board's Democratic commissioner and its chair. Edmonds served as chair of the commission from March 3, 1883 to April 1, 1886, at which time both his presidency and his term as a commissioner expired. President Grover Cleveland offered him reappointment, but Edmonds turned it down. According to the "Washington Post", "Mr. Edmonds was one of the most efficient and popular officials of those who have presided over the affairs of the district, and his refusal to accept a renomination for office was greatly regretted."
Edmonds died at his home on K Street in Washington on December 29, 1900, at the age of sixty-nine.
James Barker Edmonds Elementary School in Washington, DC was named in his honor in 1903. It closed in the 1970's and was occupied at various times by a credit union, the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, the Associates for Renewal in Education and a day care center. In 2014 it became a condominium known as the Edmonds School.

TV10 would have been the first official Dutch commercial TV channel airing in the Netherlands. The launch date was set on 1 November 1989. The TV Station was a cooperation between Peter Jelgersma and Joop van den Ende. The Dutch government was, at the time, against commercial television and prohibited it from broadcasting. The channel would have been a general entertainment channel.

Flora Murray

Dr. Flora Murray, M.D. CBE (8 May 1869 – 28 July 1923) was a Scottish medical pioneer and a member of the Women's Social and Political Union suffragettes.
Flora was born at Murraythwaite, Dumfries, Scotland, daughter of John Murray, a landowner and Royal Navy Captain, and Grace Harriet Graham. She trained at the London School of Medicine for Women and finished her course at Durham. She then worked in Scotland before returning to London.
In 1905 Murray was a medical officer at the Belgrave Hospital for Children and then anaesthetist at the Chelsea Hospital for Women.
She joined the Women's Social and Political Union in 1908, and acted as physician to the militants. She spoke at meetings and rallies, marched in processions, provided first aid at suffragette demonstrations, and looked after Emmeline Pankhurst and other hunger-strikers after their release from prison. She campaigned with other doctors against the forcible feeding of prisoners.
In 1912 she founded the Women's Hospital for Children at 688 Harrow Road with Louisa Garrett Anderson. It provided both health care for working-class children of the area, and gave women doctors their only opportunity to gain clinical experience in paediatrics in London; the hospital's motto was "Deeds not Words".
In the First World War she served in France with the Women's Hospital Corps (WHC). Along with her friend and colleague Dr. Louisa Garrett Anderson, she established military hospitals for the French Army in Paris and Wimereux. Their proposals were at first rejected by the British authorities, but eventually the WHC became established at the military hospital, Endell Street Military Hospital, Holborn, London staffed entirely by women, from chief surgeon to orderlies. Their motto "Deeds not Words" was used for the second time.
She never married and is buried at the Holy Trinity Church with her friend and colleague, Dr. Louisa Garrett Anderson near to their home in Penn, Buckinghamshire. Garrett's tombstone reads "We have been gloriously happy".

Terry Larkin

Frank S. "Terry" Larkin (1856 – September 16, 1894) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for five teams during a six-season career.
Larkin, a right-hander, debuted on May 20, for the New York Mutuals, pitching a complete game in his only appearance of the season. He pitched in for the Hartford Dark Blues, posting a 29-25 record while pitching 501 innings. He then moved to the Chicago White Stockings for the and seasons, going 29-26 in 1878 and 31-23 in 1879, pitching over 500 innings each season. Larkin was a good hitter for a pitcher and finished 8th in the National League with 32 runs batted in (RBI), while hitting for a .288 average in 1878.
In the midst of the 1879 season, Larkin developed arm trouble and the main pitching duties fell to third baseman Frank Hankinson, although Larkin continued to pitch. His arm problems worsened and after five games, the Troy Trojans released him and he was out of Major League Baseball until .
Larkin made headlines on April 24, 1883 when he shot and injured his wife and a police officer, then tried to commit suicide. Failing in that, he attempted suicide again the next day. Larkin's wife refused to press charges and he was soon released by the police. Larkin was arrested again on February 18, 1884 for threatening to shoot his father. Soon released again, Larkin managed to sign and play for the Richmond Virginians of the American Association and was their everyday second baseman when they became a mid-season replacement for the disbanded Washington Nationals.
Larkin was later institutionalized after challenging his former employer to a duel with pistols, and while apparently still hospitalized committed suicide by slitting his throat with a razor on September 16, 1894 in Brooklyn, New York. He is interred at Calvary Cemetery in Woodside, New York.

<doc id="9367138" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9367138" title="Marine Police Force">
Marine Police Force

The Marine Police Force, sometimes known as the Thames River Police, claimed to be England's oldest police force and was formed by magistrate Patrick Colquhoun and Master Mariner John Harriott in 1798 to tackle theft and looting from ships anchored in the Pool of London and in the lower reaches and docks of the Thames. Pre-dating the Metropolitan Police, it merged in 1839 with that nascent force instigated by Robert Peel. Its base was (and remains) in Wapping High Street. It has gradually evolved into the Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit.
Where a 'police force' extends beyond organised constables of a single borough or City Corporation this constitutes the oldest force in England.
Merchants were losing an estimated £500,000 () of stolen cargo annually from the Pool of London on the River Thames by the late 1790s. A plan was devised to curb the problem in 1797 by an Essex Justice of the Peace and master mariner, John Harriot, who joined forces with Patrick Colquhoun and utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham. Armed with Harriot's proposal and Bentham's insights, Colquhoun was able to persuade the West India Planters Committees and the West India Merchants to fund the new force. They agreed to a one-year trial and on 2 July 1798, after receiving government permission, the Thames River Police began operating with Colquhoun as Superintending Magistrate and Harriot the Resident Magistrate.
With the initial investment of £4,200, the new force began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades, of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and "on the game". The river police first received a hostile reception by those dockyard and wharf workers not wishing to lose an illicit income. A mob of 2,000 attempted to burn down the police office with the police inside. The skirmish that followed resulted in the first line of duty death for the new force with the killing of Gabriel Franks.
Nevertheless, Colquhoun reported to his backers that his force was a success after its first year, and his men had "established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives." Word of this success spread quickly, and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800, transforming it from a private to public police agency. Colquhoun published a book on the experiment, "The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames". It found receptive audiences far outside London, and inspired similar forces in other countries, notably, New York, Dublin, and Sydney.
Historians of policing credit Colquhoun's innovation as a critical development leading up to Robert Peel's "new" police three decades later. Along with the Bow Street Runners, the Thames River Police was eventually absorbed by the Metropolitan Police in the 19th century. Colquhoun's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit analysis to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives. Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street, the river police were full-time, salaried officers prohibited from taking fees.
The idea of a salaried police as it existed in France was considered an affront to the English ruling class who favoured ad hoc justice, particularly during this century of economic change. Britain was industrialising and expanding its Empire. Cautious of being seen as autocratic, many politicians felt the existing often sporadic local justice system with severe penalties should not be nationalised. Colquhoun made an economic rather than political case to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was "perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution". Moreover, he went so far as to praise the French system, which had reached "the greatest degree of perfection".
As impressive as Colquhoun's ability to sell the idea of a publicly funded police force was, his main contribution is recognized as the introduction of crime prevention, or preventive policing, as a fundamental principle to the English police system. His police were to be a deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames. He arrived at this conclusion by viewing crime fighting as a science, and in utilitarian fashion, attempted to press that science into the service of the national economy. He published two dozen treatises on a variety of social problems, but the most significant is his 1797 "A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis".
On creation, they took a lease of premises on the current site of Wapping Police Station and appointed a "Superintendent of Ship Constables" with 5 "surveyors" to patrol the river, day and night. These surveyors were rowed in open galleys by "police watermen". They also had 4 surveyors visiting ships being loaded and unloaded, with "Ship Constables" (who were appointed and controlled by the Marine Police Force but paid for by ship owners) supervising gangs of dockers. A "Surveyor of Quays" with two assistants and 30 "Police Quay Guards" watched over cargoes on shore.
By 1829, the force had expanded to occupy three stations at Wapping, Waterloo, and Blackwall.
Thames Division was formed in 1839 with the amalgamation of the Marine Police Force with the Metropolitan Police Force. Initially patrols were conducted in rowing boats, some of which remained in use until 1905. Impetus to change was provided when, on 3 September 1878, the steam collier "Bywell Castle" ran into the pleasure steamer in Galleons Reach with the loss of over 600 lives. The subsequent inquest and inquiry recommended that Thames Division should have steam launches, as rowing galleys had shown themselves to be inadequate for police duty, and the first two were commissioned in the mid-1880s. By 1898, the force had a further 8 steam launches to supplement its rowing galleys. In 1910 the first motor vessels were introduced. The original Marine Police has been commemorated with police vessel names including the supervision launches "John Harriott" (1947-1963) and "Patrick Colquhoun" (1963-2003), and Targa duty boats in use, the "John Harriott" and the "Gabriel Franks".
The London Docks by the 1960s moved chiefly to Tilbury. Along the tideway small goods wharfs have been demolished however instead tourist and visitor harbours and jetties do operate. Traffic in the Pool of London has become more recreational. The Marine Police Force's Wapping High Street site is used as the headquarters of the successor body, the Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit. Crimes such as dangerous or drunken charge of a vessel and drugs and arms possession or importation supplement rescue duties shared with RNLI lifeboats, a London Fire Brigade fire boat, and Coastguard services.
Counterfeit goods could also be enforced by other enforcement bodies including HM Customs and Excise and responsibility for this today is shared with today's UK Visas and Immigration who have particular expertise in this area.

Heptahedron

A heptahedron (plural: heptahedra) is a polyhedron having seven sides, or faces.
A heptahedron can take a surprising number of different basic forms, or topologies. Probably most familiar are the hexagonal pyramid and the pentagonal prism. Also notable is the tetrahemihexahedron, whose seven equilateral triangle faces form a rudimentary projective plane. No heptahedra are regular.
There are 34 topologically distinct "convex" heptahedra, excluding mirror images. (Two polyhedra are "topologically distinct" if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.)
An example of each type is depicted below, along with the number of sides on each of the faces. The images are ordered by descending number of six-sided faces (if any), followed by descending number of five-sided faces (if any), and so on.

Dennis Herbert, 1st Baron Hemingford

Dennis Henry Herbert, 1st Baron Hemingford KBE PC (25 February 1869 – 10 December 1947), was a British Conservative politician.
Herbert was the eldest son of Reverend Henry Herbert, Rector of Hemingford Abbots in Huntingdonshire. He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Watford at the 1918 general election, a seat he held until 1943. From 1928 to 1929 he served as Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and from 1931 to 1943 as Chairman of Ways and Means (Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons). Appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1929, Herbert was admitted to the Privy Council in 1933 and on 1 February 1943 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hemingford, of Watford in the County of Hertford.
Lord Hemingford married Mary, daughter of Valentine Graeme Bell, in 1903. He died in December 1947, aged 78, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Dennis George Ruddock Herbert. Lady Hemingford died in 1966.
Between 1918 and 1943, Herbert lived in a Victorian villa at 36 Clarendon Road, Watford. This locally listed building building was later used as a registry office until it was demolished in 2015 by Hertfordshire County Council to make way for a block of flats and offices.
A 1944 portrait of Herbert by the Scottish painter George Harcourt hangs in the Watford Museum, and there are also photographic portraits of Herbert by the high-society portrait photographers Bassano & Vandyk in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London.

Tosanoumi Toshio

Tosanoumi Toshio (born February 16, 1972 as Toshio Yamamoto in Aki City, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan), is a former sumo wrestler. He first reached the top division of professional sumo in 1995, winning 13 special prizes and earning 11 gold stars for defeating "yokozuna" over his long career. The highest rank he reached was "sekiwake". He retired in 2010 to become a coach at his stable, Isenoumi stable under the name of Tatekawa.
After success in amateur sumo competitions while at Doshisha University, where he was a two-time winner of the All Western Japan Sumo Championships in 1992 and 1993, Yamamoto was recruited by former "sekiwake" Fujinokawa and joined Isenoumi stable. He was given the "shikona" of Tosanoumi, meaning "sea of Tosa", from his native Kōchi Prefecture. Because of his amateur achievements he had "makushita tsukedashi" status and entered professional sumo in the third, "makushita" division in March 1994. He entered "jūryō" four tournaments later. Another four tournaments later he was promoted to the highest, "makuuchi" division. Because he had won the "yūshō" or tournament championship with a 14-1 record from the rank of "jūryō" 1, he entered at "maegashira" 7, the second highest ever rank at which to enter the top division after Daiju in 1970. For his first "makuuchi" bouts he was drawn against some tough opponents; first "ōzeki" Wakanohana, followed by "yokozuna" Takanohana the second day. He lost both bouts, and would finish the tournament 7-8.
Recovering from this, his first ever "make-koshi", Tosanoumi continued to rise through the ranks, reaching "komusubi" in January 1996 and "sekiwake" in May 1997. His best result in a tournament came in November 1998, when he finished as runner-up to Kotonishiki with 12 wins. Although he never rose higher than "sekiwake", he held the rank for seven tournaments in total, the last being in May 2005. He was also ranked at "komusubi" on thirteen occasions, for a total of twenty tournaments in the "san'yaku" ranks. He remained in "makuuchi" continuously from July 1995 until January 2006, when a 5-10 result at "maegashira" 14 resulted in demotion to "jūryō". He reappeared in "makuuchi" just two tournaments later in May 2006, but remained at the bottom of the division. He fell to "jūryō" on three further occasions, in May 2007, March 2008 and September 2008, but each time made an immediate return to the top division.
Tosanoumi won a total of thirteen prizes (equal to the seventh highest ever) and eleven gold stars (the fourth highest ever) in his long "makuuchi" career. He defeated two "yokozuna" in the same tournament on four separate occasions. He earned four gold stars from Takanohana, and three each from Wakanohana and Akebono. His last gold star came in 2003 when he beat Musashimaru, in what was the latter's last bout before retirement. In July 2007 he recorded his 600th career win, which came by default when his opponent withdrew. Tosanoumi is eighth on the all-time list of most top division appearances, and ninth for most tournaments ranked in the top division.
He became the oldest active "sekitori" after the March 2009 tournament following the retirement of Ōtsukasa. However, he was unable to maintain his "makuuchi" position, dropping to jūryō 6 after winning only four matches at "Maegashira" 15. An 8-7 record in May was not enough to return him to the top division this time. He could manage only a 5-10 score in July, his first ever "jūryō" "make-koshi". He recorded his 700th career win in the January 2010 tournament, the first "makushita tsukedashi" entrant to achieve this feat.
Following the large number of demotions to the "jūryō" division in September 2010 after six wrestlers were suspended from competition he made a surprise return to the top division, becoming at 38 years and six months the oldest man ever to do so. He was however out of his depth and scored only 2-13, resulting in demotion straight back to "jūryō".
In November 2010 Tosanoumi could score only 4-11 at "jūryō" 8, which would have resulted in demotion to the "makushita" division. This broke a run of 97 consecutive tournaments at a "sekitori" rank. Instead Tosanoumi chose to retire, announcing his decision on December 15 shortly before the release of the new rankings. He has stayed in sumo as a coach at Isenoumi stable under the "toshiyori" name Tatekawa, and his "danpatsu-shiki" or official retirement ceremony took place at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan on May 28, 2011.
Tosanoumi's fighting style was solidly "oshi-sumo", using pushing and thrusting techniques as opposed to "yotsu-sumo" or grappling techniques. He has attributed his relative lack of injuries during his career in part to this preference. Over 30 percent of his wins in sumo were "oshi-dashi", a simple push out.
Tosanoumi announced in September 2008 that he would be getting married. The wedding reception and ceremony were held in January 2009.

I'm Standing Here

I'm Standing Here is an early EP by Japanese rock band, ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION, released on November 30, 2001.
Including their split mini-album with rock musician Caramelman, "I'm Standing Here" was the third and last independent EP the band recorded before releasing their major-label debut EP, "Hōkai Amplifier". In contrast to their previous indie releases, the band composed the songs featured on the mini-album mostly with Japanese lyrics. While the mini-album retained only one single, "Konayuki," it came to receive significant airplay on indie radio stations and a redone version was later included within the band's debut EP. Additionally, "E" would later be redone for their first full-length album, "Kimi Tsunagi Five M", while "Hold Me Tight" would be re-recorded for the single, "Kimi no Machi Made," and included on their compilation album, "Feedback File".

Noordkaap

Noordkaap was a Belgian rock band with Stijn Meuris as singer. They had several well-known songs such as "Ik Hou Van U" and "Satelliet S.U.Z.Y."
In 1990 Stijn Meuris, Lars Van Bambost, Eric Sterckx, Wim De Wilde, Nico Van Calster founded Noordkaap and won "Humo's Rock Rally" that same year.
Their cover of Will Tura's "Arme Joe" got a lot of attention and they were offered a record deal. By the end of 1991 they released their debut album "Feest in de stad". In 1994, under a new record label, they released "Gigant".
A year later Noordkaap made the soundtrack for the movie "Manneken Pis" and reached a broader audience. The single "Ik hou van u" was in the charts for many weeks. In honor of Belgium's 175th anniversary in 2005, it was re-released in a blend of French and Dutch.
After releasing the soundtrack for "Alles moet weg" in 1996, it got quiet. Several members left the group, leaving only Meuris and Van Bambost. When Mario Goossens, Anton Janssens and Wladimir Geels joined, Noordkaap was back and released "Massis" in 1999.
On April 1, 2000 they gave their final concert in the "Ancienne Belgique" in Brussels. Lars Van Bambost joined Novastar, and Stijn Meuris started a new band called Monza.

Reggie Kinlaw (born January 9, 1957) is a former American football defensive tackle who played college football for the Oklahoma Sooners and for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders and Seattle Seahawks in the National Football League. He graduated from Miami Springs Senior High School.
Drafted in the final round of the 1979 NFL Draft, Kinlaw soon worked his way into the rotation on the defensive line. He went on to become a mainstay at the nose tackle position, starting on Raider Super Bowl winners following the 1980 and 1983 seasons. He was considered an unsung hero on those defenses, which featured stars like Ted Hendricks, Rod Martin, Matt Millen, and, later, Howie Long, Lyle Alzado, and Greg Townsend. Despite being somewhat undersized at 6-2 and 250 pounds, Kinlaw's quickness demanded double teams, freeing up his teammates to make big plays.
Reggie Kinlaw now coaches the defensive line on the varsity level at St. Francis High School in La Cañada Flintridge, California. His son Reggie Kinlaw, Jr. also coaches defensive line on the Junior Varsity level at St. Francis High School.

Doug Smith (footballer, born 1937)

Douglas Bryan Smith (18 November 1937 – 5 December 2012) was a Scottish footballer who played his entire career as centre half for Dundee United.
Smith was born in Aberdeen and played for local junior team Aberdeen Lads Club. He signed for Dundee United in 1958 and spent all of his playing days at Tannadice, appearing in 628 competitive matches. Remarkably – and unusually for a defender – Smith never received a booking throughout his entire playing career. With just a 1974 Scottish Cup runners-up medal to show from his time, Smith retired in 1976, although he returned in 1983 to the club board. In 1992, Smith was elected as vice-chairman and became chairman in October 2000 following Jim McLean's resignation, with an appointment as president of the Scottish Football League in-between (1997). In January 2002, following an acrimonious EGM, Smith left the club.
Smith's brother Dave was a professional footballer with Aberdeen and Rangers in the 1960s and 70s.

<doc id="9367278" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9367278" title="Longchengpterus">
Longchengpterus

Longchengpterus was a genus of istiodactylid pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Barremian-Aptian-age Lower Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Chaoyang, Liaoning, China. The genus was named in 2006 by Wang Li, Li Li, Duan Ye and Cheng Shao-li. The genus name is derived from the old name of Chaoyang City, "Longcheng", and a Latinised Greek "pteron", "wing". The specific name honours Zhao Dayu, the president of Shenyang Normal University and a contributor to the founding of the Western Liaoning Institute of Mesozoic Paleontology.
"Longchengpterus" is based on holotype LPM 00023, found at Yuanjiawa near Dapingfanga, a compressed incomplete skeleton and partial skull on a single plate. The posterior part of the skull has been damaged. It is elongated with a length of 262 millimetres. The large skull opening, the "fenestra nasantorbitalis", is triangular in form and occupies much of the snout. The teeth in the upper jaw are concentrated in the front part and spaced far apart; their number is uncertain. The lower jaws have been well preserved. They are 220 millimetres long and their symphysis is short. Twelve teeth are present in the dentary. They have a sharp point but are laterally compressed, curving slightly inwards.
The humerus, 88 millimetres long, has a low deltopectoral crest and no pneumatic foramen. The fourth metacarpal is longer than the first phalanx of the wing finger. The wingspan was about two metres. The pelvis has been heavily damaged. Part of a femur is present, its estimated length was 91 millimetres.
"Longchengpterus" has been assigned to the Istiodactylidae sharing with "Istiodactylus" tooth form and count as well as a large skull opening. A notable difference is the lack of a broad snout. It was the second istiodactylid named and the first from China, adding to the known pterosaur diversity from Early Cretaceous layers of China.

Rick Bryan

Rick Don Bryan (March 20, 1962 – July 25, 2009) was an American college and professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons during the 1980s and 1990s. Bryan played college football for the University of Oklahoma, and received All-American honors. He was selected in the first round of the 1984 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Atlanta Falcons of the NFL.
Bryan was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He attended Coweta High School in Coweta, Oklahoma where he earned All-State honors in 1980.

Sports Plus Network

Sports Plus Network was a service run by SportsChannel in the late 1980s and early 1990s that filled the airtime when SportsChannel was not on the air. It was an "automated" service that featured sports news and scores displayed using NAPLPS graphics that made it look like the online service Prodigy, including a noticeable loading time for pages, which were "drawn" on the screen with primitive shapes.
The service appears to have had some similarity to teletext, but the major difference was that it was not interactive, stories stay on screen for a few seconds and it moves to the next screen.
Advertisements were placed on screen every few minutes, and were drawn with the same NAPLPS graphics, again looking very much like advertisements on Prodigy.
According to the ticker that scrolled at the bottom of the screen, the service was a joint venture by SportsChannel, Tribune Media Services, and the Associated Press.
In early 1991, the graphics used were updated.
The channel could sometimes be seen on a monitor in the newsroom on the set of "Murphy Brown".

Luana Walters

Luana Walters (July 22, 1912 – May 19, 1963) was a motion picture actress from Los Angeles, California.
Walters was an expert horsewoman which led to her discovery as an actress at a rodeo in Palm Springs, California. She won a woman's bucking contest which was being watched by a movie scout, who noticed her.
Her film career began when she visited a friend on a United Artists lot. Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. was excited about her screen possibilities and arranged for a film test. However, only three days later Fairbanks went to Europe, and the test was never completed.
Not long afterwards Joe Schenck saw Walters on the dance floor at the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles, California. After viewing the abbreviated test made by Fairbanks, Schenck offered her a contract with United Artists. The studio did not make a movie in the next six months so Walters' option was not taken up.
Walters' screen credits start with an uncredited role in "Reaching for the Moon" (1930). Her skill as an equestrian helped her in parts in westerns like "Ride 'Em Cowboy" (1936), "Where the West Begins" (1938), "Mexicali Rose" (1939), and "Law of the Wolf" (1939).
On several occasions Walters made films in which her work was left in the cutting room, from the final edit. This began when she made "Reaching for the Moon" with Fairbanks. Her parts were also deleted from "Spawn of the North" (1938) and "Souls at Sea" (1937). The former was a Henry Fonda feature and the latter paired Walters with Robert Cummings.
Walters was the first actress to portray Superman's biological mother Lara in a live-action format. She appeared in "Superman Comes to Earth", the first chapter of the 1948 "Superman" movie serial starring Kirk Alyn as Superman. Portions of this depiction appear in flashback in "At the Mercy of Atom Man!", the seventh chapter of the 1950 serial "Atom Man vs. Superman".
As a fiery and sensual brunette, she worked in a number of movie serials and B-Movies, especially in Westerns, featuring her riding skills, and sci-fi or horror genres.
She played a female reporter on the trail of a fiend's story in "The Corpse Vanishes" (1942), with Bela Lugosi. She appears as a cellblock guard in "Girls in Prison" (1956). Her final role came in "The She Creature" (1956).
Luana Walters died of liver failure due to alcoholism in Los Angeles in 1963.

Craig previously represented Scotland at rugby league, playing for Wigan, Halifax, Widnes and Swinton. He switched to rugby union joining Orrell in 2000, before moving to Glasgow in the summer of 2004. He then moved to Leeds Tykes for the 2005/2006 season.
Craig earned his first cap for Scotland on Saturday, 15 June 2002 against Canada in Vancouver. His debut was for a lost cause. The Scots lost 26-23.
Craig was an important member of the Scotland team for the 2003 Six Nations Championship. He played only a handful of games in the 2004 season. His luck changed again in 2005, when under the reign of the Matt Williams he was the starting outside centre. Although it was a disappointing season for Scotland (one win against Italy), Craig scored two tries. One against Wales due to an overlap and one against England after some fine work from Chris Paterson.
Craig suffered a setback after picking up an injury during the 2005/6 season for Glasgow. He returned to action for a few games after his injury and subsequently scored a try in one of his games. Craig, however, had not been considered by Frank Hadden for the Scotland team for the Autumn Internationals and the 2006 Six Nations Championship.
Craig decided to move from full-time rugby to semi-professional rugby. Lured by the prospect of managing a plumbing career whilst playing rugby, Craig decided to join Sedgley Park.
Craig now runs a full-time plumbing and heating contraction company based in Warrington.

King's Swan

King's Swan (1980–2006) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse nicknamed "The King of Aqueduct" who was so popular with New York City area fans that on his retirement from racing at age ten, he was honored with a retirement ceremony at Aqueduct Racetrack.
King's Swan was sired by King's Bishop, a son of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Round Table, and was out of the mare Royal Cygnet. His damsire, Sea-Bird, holds the record for the highest Timeform rating in history.
Despite his breeding, by age five King's Swan had accomplished little on the racetrack and was put up for sale in claiming races. Trainer Richard Dutrow, Sr., one of Maryland racing's Big Four trainers, recognized the gelding's racing potential and in mid December 1985 organized a partnership to purchase him. The horse soon began winning important graded stakes races in his first season under Dutrow.
King's Swan became one of the best-loved horses on the New York racing circuit. At age ten in 1990, he was still campaigning and winning stakes events, notably capturing his second Aqueduct Handicap.
As a gelding, King's Swan was not able to serve as a sire and following his December 22, 1990, retirement he was given to Jean Lazio, his longtime exercise rider. In early December 2005, he shattered a bone in his right front leg that was aggravated after treatment. On February 7, 2006, at the age of twenty-six, King's Swan was humanely euthanized at the Mid-Atlantic Equine Center in Ringoes, New Jersey.

George Patrick Welch was a historian and author, whose works include "Britannia: The Roman Conquest and Occupation of Britain".
He was born in 1900 in Boston, Massachusetts, and was educated at Harvard from which he graduated in 1923. For fifteen years thereafter he was active in investment banking, retiring in 1938 to write. In the next few years he published many short stories and articles, plus a historical novel, "Final Hosting". Then came Pearl Harbor and the Army. As a soldier, Colonel Welch served through World War II and for some ten years after in various posts in the United States, the Africa-Middle East Theatre and Japan. During the Korean War he commanded an artillery battalion at the Inchon landing, the assault on Seoul, and the march to the Yalu River. He also served as General Matthew Ridgeway's Information Officer. He made headlines in "Time" magazine in 1952 because of his involvement in exposing information leaks between American and Russian journalists. Some war correspondents, said Welch, had been abusing their rights at Panmunjom by "fraternization and trafficking with the enemy." He said they were guilty of "excessive social consorting, including drinking of alcoholic beverages, with Communist 'journalists.'" Retired as a full colonel in 1956, he held the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, the Korean Campaign Medal with four stars and the Air Medal.
Besides his two books, he also wrote a play, "Assignment in Judea", a fact-based fictional account of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus Christ from the Romans' and Pontius Pilate's perspectives. It premiered in Florida in 1964.
He lived his final years in Colorado Springs, surrounded by his friends in the extensive military complexes headquartered there, including the Air Force Academy, Fort Carson and NORAD. He died in 1973.

The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit

The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit is a children’s book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter, and first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in December 1906. The book tells of a bad little rabbit who is fired upon by a hunter and loses his tail and whiskers. The book was intended for babies and very young children, and was originally published on a strip of paper that folded into a wallet and was tied with a ribbon. The format was unpopular with booksellers, and eventually reprinted in the standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit library. Although the book sold well, there are not many left in existence. It provides the young child with an introduction to books and the Peter Rabbit universe.
A bad rabbit finds a good rabbit sitting on a bench eating a carrot his mother gave him. Wanting the carrot, he takes it from the good rabbit and scratches him. The good rabbit escapes and hides in a nearby hole. Meanwhile, a hunter notices the bad rabbit sitting on the bench and mistakes him for a bird. He fires at the bad rabbit, but finds nothing but a carrot and a rabbit tail on the bench. The good rabbit then sees the bad rabbit running away without his whiskers and tail.
"The Tale of A Fierce Bad Rabbit" was written for Louie Warne, the daughter of Potter's publisher, Harold Warne. The child thought Peter Rabbit much too well-behaved and wanted a story about a truly bad rabbit. Potter was experimenting with toy books at the time and "A Fierce Bad Rabbit" was published for Christmas 1906 in a panorama format of fourteen pictures and text printed from left to right on a long strip of paper that folded accordion-fashion into a wallet tied with a ribbon. The format was popular with readers but unpopular with booksellers who found the item too difficult to keep folded, tied, and in its place once curious customers opened and examined it.
In 1916, Potter completed a new frontispiece for the tale, and "A Fierce Bad Rabbit" was reprinted in a slightly smaller format than the other books in the Peter Rabbit library. Today, the book is printed in the standard small format of the series.
Potter's three panorama books of 1906 – "The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit", "The Story of Miss Moppet", and "The Sly Old Cat" – are vignettes rather than the typical tales she produced of causality, extended plot, and variety of character. Each story has a very limited cast of characters with one dominant character (the title character), and each is dependent upon an archetypal animosity: rabbit versus hunter and cat versus rodent. In their simplicity and unusual format, these stories were intended for babies and very young children, but Potter was never at her best when writing for a clearly defined audience. "A Fierce Bad Rabbit" fails for this reason, and for its overt moralizing and stiff illustrations. Most damaging to the book's success are the two rabbits. Both lack the adorable cuteness of Peter Rabbit and his kin.
"A Fierce Bad Rabbit" focuses on a traditional rather than a creative approach to storytelling and reflects Potter's inexperience with babies and very young children. She appears to be more interested in naming and designating this or that rather than developing plot and exploring character. She names and directs the child's attention to the rabbit's tail, whiskers, and claws, for example, rather than to the animal's facial expression. When the hunter appears, he is blandy introduced with, "This is a man with a gun." The gun goes off as expected with the stereotypical "BANG!" instead of a more creative onomatopoeia term Potter would have surely devised had she been writing this book for older children.
The panorama books are not Potter's best efforts, but do demonstrate her ability to pare text and illustrations to essentials. She worked best though with more complicated plots and characters, and with specific settings rather than generalized backgrounds. Her inexperience with babies and very young children is evident in the original panorama format itself for a long strip of paper and a wallet are likely to be mutilated by the very young. The story in its current standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit series is considered to provide very young children with an introduction to books in general and to the world of Peter Rabbit.
Pop culture references:
The book is referenced in the final episode of To Play the King. The Prime Minister states that Britain is "a nation of fierce, bad rabbits," and that Potter, more than any other writer, influenced his personal prose style.

Château du Bernstein

The Château du Bernstein is a ruined castle in the "commune" of Dambach-la-Ville, in the Bas-Rhin "département" of France. It is situated at an altitude of 557m (~1810 ft).
Originally, the castle belonged to the Counts of Eguisheim Dabo. After the siege of 1227, it became the property of the bishop of Strasbourg and seat of the episcopal bailiffs until 1580. Abandoned from this date, the buildings fell into ruin.
The castle at Bernstein is among the oldest in Alsace. It was first mentioned at the beginning of the 11th century, though the northern surrounding wall can be dated to prehistoric times. The upper castle with keep, manor house and advanced works probably dates from the end of the 12th century and start of the 13th. In the Gothic era, the manor house was separated from the keep by a ditch, transformed later into a cistern. Towards the end of the 15th century, the St. Marguerite tower, so called from the name of the chapel there, was built in the rear courtyard. Around 1835, Félix Dartein cleared the ground of the lower castle to build a house and some outbuildings which have disappeared.
The remains visible today date from several eras:
The Château du Bernstein is state property and has been listed as a "monument historique" by the French Ministry of Culture since 1931.
