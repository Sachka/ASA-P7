Orient Hospital

The Orient Hospital () was a Lebanese non-profit hospital located in Beirut and maintained for the care of low-income patients. It was founded in 1947 by Dr. Sami Ibrahim Haddad, a well-known physician and historian of medicine.
The 54-bed hospital overlooked Saint George Bay in Beirut. The main structure was a renovated five-story building with a newly built annex for nurses. The ground floor consisted of admissions, a reception hall enclosed by consultation offices, a medical laboratory and an OPD. The second floor was devoted to surgical beds and the third floor housed the medical patients. The fourth floor consisted of a single operating theater and its sterilizing equipment as well as an adjacent 50-seat lecture hall. The fifth floor, surrounded by a terrace, served as living quarters for interns.
The hospital had four departments, urology and urosurgery, neuro-surgery, obstetrics and radiology. External specialists were allowed to admit and operate upon their patients at the hospital.
It also had a superlative library containing a great number of manuscripts on a wide range of subjects such as Arabic medicine, biology, religion, numismatics, history, literature and Arabic geometry and astronomy. The collection, including the Annual Reports of the Orient Hospital, is now in the Sami Ibrahim Haddad Memorial Library.
The hospital was run and administered by its founder, Sami Ibrahim Haddad, until his death in 1957 and then by his sons, Dr. Farid Sami Haddad and Dr. Fuad Sami Haddad. The Orient Hospital closed its doors in 1976, at the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War. It was later demolished by its owners to prevent gunmen occupying it, as it was in the heavily fought over area of downtown Beirut.

Jaroslav Volek

Jaroslav Volek (15 July 1923, Trenčín – 23 February 1989, Prague) was a Czech musicologist, semiotician who developed a theory of modal music. His theory included ideas of poly-modality and alteration of notes that he called "flex," which result in what he called the system of flexible diatonics. He applied this theory to the work of Béla Bartók and Leoš Janáček. He wrote "General Theory of Art" based on semiotic concepts in 1968.
During his life he was blacklisted by the authorities of the communist soviet dominated government of Czechoslovakia, who seldom allowed publication of his work. The result is a scarcity of biographical material that is contemporaneous from his homeland, with more available in German translation, or published in English after his death. Late in his life he was allowed to travel, and was a guest at American University during the 1980s.
He is particularly cited in relation to the works of 20th-century European composers, because his theory directly confronts the relationship between melodies based on speech and modal sources, with the classical music harmonic tradition of tonality.
Jaroslav Volek "New Forms of Modality in Leoš Janáček's Song Cycle "The Diary of One who Vanished"", p. 37. Translated by Jan Vičar
Volek argues first that music is not an acoustical phenomenon, but a phenomenon of understanding and incorporating acoustical phenomenon into the psychological. From this, in a structuralist manner, he argues that the actual laws of music come from historical and social forces based on the social practice of music. He argues that musicology must, therefore, study the concrete history of musical practice to be empirical, and not merely sound. The "tangling" together of sound, practice and psychology constitutes music, and therefore the unwinding of these forces and their study constitutes musicology.
Since music exists not only in perception, but in memory, Volek asserted that the remembering of musical events plays a powerful role in the interpretation of new perceptions. From his study of musical practice, he argued that the fundamental unit of musical remembering is the musical step—the second—and that from systems of seconds modes are constructed that allow the memory to structure the distance between two pitches. This distance is not an absolute measured by ratios of vibration, but relative, based on the mode that structures the way the pitches are remembered.
From this he constructs a hierarchy of linear and vertical relationships that "bond" the notes to the sensations. Each bond has a tonal function. The first function is a bond that is linear, he calls it the melodic bond, and argues that the melodic bond is the most powerful. From the soundings of the melodic bond, vertical "chordal bonds" are remembered. This is the second function. The characteristics of a chordal bond can be deteremined from the dominant interval in the melodic bond, which combines the first two functions to produce the third function. From this, he argues that the mediant and its chromatic alteration combines the first three to produce the fourth tonal function.
From this, he applied his theory to the art music of Europe (classical music). He argued that the 12 tones of the chromatic scale could be "colonized" (in music theory: made reachable through melodic and harmonic means), as flexible notes in the original diatonic scale of seven notes. He called this "flexible diatonicism", and differentiated flex from chromaticism. Chromatic notes are those heard as outside the scale system. Flexed notes are heard within the modal scale system.
The components of a piece, according to Volek, bond together to produce "tectonics," the construction of larger out of smaller. The bond, that is the tonal function, that joins two components is called the "responsible bond" and the tectonicity of a work is the structure of the bonds. What this means is that components dominate their moment, but the joining of components—notes, chords, melodic themes—produces the shape and tension in a work. This is similar to Arnold Schoenberg's idea that individual notes have a structural function.
For Volek, elements that are responsible are largely forced in their handling, whereas individual expression comes from the use of non-responsible elements. In classical music, Volek argued, harmony is the dominant tectonic force. Within this general force, individualized choices allow flexibility for individual expression.

Super de Boer

Super de Boer was a Dutch supermarket chain which operated in the country. The holding company which owned Super de Boer, "Super de Boer N.V." was formerly named "Laurus N.V.", but changed its name to that of its only remaining retail brand in January 2008.
There are currently no Super de Boer stores anymore in the Netherlands. Before the supermarkets were partly owned by franchisors. The French food retail group Casino Guichard purchased a 37% stake in the firm in 2002, and increased this to 57% by 2008. The firm agreed to be taken private by Dutch rival Jumbo in October 2009 in a deal worth €552 million, with Casino selling its entire stake.
The Super de Boer name comes from grocery stores opened by brothers Evert and Jan De Boer in 1925 and 1932. The two De Boer chains merged in 1970. In 1997, De Boer and rival Unigro formed De Boer Unigro. The De Boer supermarket chain was merged with Unigro's Super to form Super de Boer. In 1998, De Boer Unigro merged with Vendex N.V. to form Laurus, which had plans to rebrand all the stores under the Konmar name. In 2003, Laurus stopped the rebranding operation because of disappointing results. Existing Konmar stores were either transformed back to Super de Boer or remained using the Konmar brand. In 2004, Laurus started renewing the store's image in "Operation Refresh Express". The goal of this renewal was to shake off the old, expensive image, as well as to freshen up the stores and private label products. Then, in 2006, Laurus decided to sell all of the Konmar and Edah stores to third parties, leaving Super de Boer as the only asset left for Laurus.

Mapleton-Minto 81's

The Mapleton-Minto 81's are a senior hockey team based out of Palmerston, Harriston, and Drayton, Ontario, Canada. They play in the Western Ontario Athletic Association Senior Hockey League.
Palmerston won the WOAA Grand Championship in the 1957-58 season. The current Palmerston 81's have three WOAA Sr. "A" Championships, in 1998-99, 2005–06, and 2007–08, and they have a WOAA Sr. "AA" Championship, in 2002-03.
Palmerston, the defending Senior "A" Champions, had a very strong year, with a 17-7-0 record, good for fourth in the North Division.
The 81's would face the South Division champions, the Clinton Radars in the "AA" quarter-finals. After falling behind by losing the first game of the series, Palmerston would win two in a row in overtime to take a 2-1 series lead. Clinton would come back and win two in a row to put Palmerston behind 3-2, however in the sixth game, the 81's staved off elimination with a convincing 5-2 victory, forcing a seventh game in Clinton. The 81's would fall behind the Radars 3-0 after the first period and could never recover, losing 6-2 and being eliminated from the playoffs.
After starting the season off with a 7-2-1 record in their first 10 games, the 81's would slump, losing six of their next eight games, to sit with a 9-8-1 record, and push the team out of the "AA" playoff picture. Palmerston snapped out of their slump, and in their remaining eight games, they posted an impressive 7-0-1 record, and finish in fifth place in the North Division, and qualifying for the "A" playoffs.
The 81's opening opponent in the quarter-finals was the Monkton Wildcats, and Monkton surprised Palmerston with a 4-3 OT victory in the series opener, followed by a 2-1 win in the second game to take a 2-0 series lead. The 81's fought back, winning games three and four to tie the series, but the Wildcats put Palmerston on the brink of elimination with a 4-0 victory in the fifth game to take a 3-2 series lead. The 81's would once again fight back, hanging on for a 4-3 win in the sixth game, sending the series to a seventh and deciding game. Palmerston would complete the comeback, defeating Monkton 5-4, and advance to the "A" semi-finals.
Palmerston would face the defending "A" champions, the Durham Thundercats in the semi-finals, and the 81's would win a very wild opening game by a score of 9-7. Durham rebounded to tie the series up in the second game, however, Palmerston would dominate the Thundercats in the third game, winning 10-5, and taking a 2-1 series lead. Palmerston's offense stayed hot, defeating Durham 7-3 in the fourth game, and then defeating the Thundercats in the fifth game by a 7-4 score to win the series, advancing to the "A" finals.
The 81's next opponent would be the Lucknow Lancers, and after dropping the series opener by a 5-4 score, Palmerston would win the next two games by scores of 6-4 and 7-1 to take a 2-1 series lead. Lucknow evened the series with a 7-5 victory in the fourth game, however, Palmerston once again took the series lead with a solid 7-3 win in the fifth game. The 81's would hang on for a 3-2 win in the sixth game, winning the "A" championship for the second time in three seasons.
Palmerston would get off to a hot start to begin the regular season, winning their first seven games. The 81's would continue to play good hockey throughout the regular season, finishing off with a 14-4-2 record, earning 30 points, and fourth in the WOAA North Division.
Palmerston opened the playoffs against the Durham Thundercats, with the winner advancing to the "AA" quarter-finals. The 81's opened the series with a 9-2 victory, followed by a 6-2 win the second game to take a 2-0 series lead. The third game would be determined in overtime, as the scored was tied 4-4 after three periods of play, and it would be Palmerston earning the victory to take the 3-0 series lead. The fourth game would once again be tied 4-4 after regulation time, and the 81's would earn the series sweep, by scoring in the extra period and advance to the "AA" quarter-finals.
In the "AA" quarter-finals, the 81's faced off against the Saugeen Shores Winterhawks, where Saugeen Shores would take an early series lead by defeating Palmerston 5-3 in the series opener, followed by a 7-6 Winterhawks victory in the second game. Saugeen Shores would continue their winning ways in the third game, defeating the 81's 6-4 to take a 3-0 series lead. Palmerston would fight off elimination in the fourth game, defeating the Winterhawks 8-5, however, Saugeen Shores would end the 81's season in the fifth game with a 4-2 victory over Palmerston.
Palmerston would struggle during the 2009-10 season, as they finished with a record of 8-9-3, earning 19 points, and a seventh-place finish in the North Division standings.
In the playoffs, the 81's faced off against the Shelburne Muskies in a best of five qualifying round. The Muskies easily defeated the 81's by a 6-3 score in the series opener, followed by a 5-2 Shelburne win in the second game. Palmerston kept the third game close, however, Shelburne completed the three game sweep with a 4-3 win, sending Palmerston to the "A" playoffs.
In the "A" quarter-finals, the 81's would face the Lucknow Lancers. Lucknow took the first game, winning a wild one by a score of 8-6. The Lancers then took the second game by a 7-3 score, followed by a 7-4 Lucknow win in the third game as the Lancers took a 3-0 series lead. Lucknow completed the sweep in the fourth game, blowing out Palmerston 9-3 to end the 81's season.
After a very disappointing 2009-10 season, the 81's improved a little bit during the season, as the club went 13-12-1 to finish above the .500 mark, earning 27 points, and finishing in fifth place in the North Division standings. In the summer of 2011, the team announced they were merging with the Drayton Icemen and expanding their territory with it. They are now called the Mapleton-Minto 81's.
The 81's were able to maintain their 5th place spot in the North Division following the merger with Drayton, finishing the 24-game schedule with a record of 11-10-3.
They faced off against the Durham Thundercats in a North Division quarterfinal series, falling in 5 games.
The 81's started off their season with promise, defeating the defending champion Saugeen Shores Winterhawks in the Winterhawks home opener. The 81's were unable to sustain the success, and struggled to a record of 7-15-2. They finished 7th in the North Division, ahead of only the last-place Lucknow Lancers.
After falling to the 2nd-seed Winterhawks in the first round of the "AA" playoffs, the 81's withdrew from the "A" championship playoffs.
After a strong regular season, the 81's reached their first league final since 2002 by sweeping the Elora Rocks in four games in the North Division final.

Argynnis hyperbius

Argynnis hyperbius, the Indian fritillary, is a butterfly of the Nymphalid or brush-footed butterfly family.
Male: Upperside: fore wing rich orange-yellow, hind wing paler yellow, with the following black markings: Fore wing: cell with a basal short transverse streak, a medial broad oval loop, its outer margin sinuous; a broad transverse streak beyond cell not reaching the median nervure; a broad streak along the disco-cellulars; a zigzag discal series of large spots, angulated outwardly in interspace 4, inwardly in interspace 2, a minute spot at base of interspace 1 ; a somewhat diffuse large postdiscal spot below the costa in interspace 6; a postdiscal sinuous series of round spots, those in interspaces 1 and 4 very small; an inner complete subterminal sinuous series of round spots; an outer subterminal line, widening on the veins, and a terminal slender line. Hind wing: a basal, transverse, obscure narrow mark in cell, another above it in interspace 7, a transverse lunule across the middle of the cell; a small spot outwardly bordering the lower discocellular; a discal series of transverse spots from interspaces 1 to 7, sinuous posteriorly; a postdiscal series of five spots in interspaces 2 to 6 ; a subterminal series of somewhat lunular spots; finally, a narrow band on term en traversed posteriorly by a series of blue, anteriorly by a series of ochraceous lunules. Underside fore wing pale terracotta-red, shading into ochraceous towards the apex, the apex broadly suffused with that colour; markings as on the upperside, with the following exceptions:—subcostal spot in interspace 6, upper two spots of postdiscal series, upper four spots of the inner subterminal series, and the anterior portions of the outer subterminal and of the terminal line olivaceous brown; the upper two postdiscal spots centred with white, with a white spot on each side; the upper four spots of the sub terminal series connate, forming a short curved band. Hind wing variegated with ochraceous, olivaceous-brown and silvery-white markings, the last for the most part narrowly margined on the outer side by short black lines; the veins prominently pale ochraceous; the medial silvery markings form a well-marked sinuous discal series, followed by a curved postdiscal series of five olivaceous round spots; each spot and the olivaceous-brown quadrate patch near base of cell with a minute white central spot; a slender black subterminal line widening at the veins, as on the fore wing, followed by an ochraceous narrow lunular band and an outer slender black anticiliary line; the subterminal black line margined on the inner side by a series of: slender white lunules, bordered inwardly by a series of broad olivaceous-brown markings in the interspaces. Antennae brown above, ochraceous red beneath; head, thorax and abdomen olivascent tawny; beneath, palpi, thorax and abdomen pale ochraceous.
Female similar. Differs from the male as follows:—Upperside: apical half of fore wing from about the middle of the costa obliquely to just above the tornus black, inwardly suffused with purple, crossed by a broad white band from costa to the sub-terminal series of black spots; four preapical white spots, the upper three bordering on each side and above a very obscure ocellus scarcely visible on the black background, an inner and an outer subterminal transverse series of slender white lunules. Underside: fore wing markings similar to those on the upperside, but the apex of the wing beyond the white oblique band ochraceous green. Hind wing as in the male, but the markings slightly broader. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male,the abdomen paler beneath.
Wingspan: 80–98 mm.
Var. "taprobana", Moore, is a slightly darker race from Ceylon, with markings similar in both sexes to those of "hyperbius". Moore, however, states that taprobana is an intermediate between the S. Indian form ("castetsi") and typical "hyperbius" specimens from Ceylon that I have been able to examine do not- differ from Upper India, Assam, and Burmese specimens, except in the very slightly darker ground-colour on the upperside.
Race "castetsi", Oberthur.—The females of this remarkable form seem to be locally dimorphic. Male Closely resembles the male of "hyperbius" but differs as follows:—Upperside: ground-colour a richer brighter shade of orange-yellow; black markings similar but distinctly smaller, of a deeper black: subtcrminal transverse series of slender lunules traversing the terminal black margin on the hind wing of the same shade of orange-yellow as the groundcolour, not blue on the posterior half of the wing. Underside: the olivaceous brown at apex of fore and variegating the hind wing more of a greenish golden tint. A sex-mark of specialized raised scales along middle of vein 1 on the upperside of the fore wing very prominent.
Female Nilgiri form: resembles the female of typical "hyperbius" differs as follows: Upperside: ground-colour pale golden yellow; basal half of both fore and hind wings shaded with metallic green in the fore wing; in some specimens this tint is slightly olivaceous; black markings and the white oblique band on the apical area of the fore wing as in "hyperbius", but proportionately smaller, the purplish-blue shading along inner margin of the white band much less conspicuous, as is also the bluish tint; on the white preapical spots and subterminal markings on the fore wing and on the posterior half of the subterminal line of limules on the hind wing. Underside as in "hyperbius" but the ground-colour on the fore wing a paler shade of terracotta-red; the olivaceous brown variegating the hind wing of a distinctly greener tint.
Female typical form as described from Trichinopoly. Similar to the male differs as follows: Upperside: ground-colour pale golden yellow; basal half of the wings suffused with dark olivaceous green; black markings as in the male but larger; on the fore wing the spots of the subterminal series very large, coalescent or nearly coalescent with one another and with the dentate spots on the veins in the inner terminal line; the upper two spots also of the postdiscal series very large and coalescent, the upper of the two joining on above and below to the inner postdiscal lunate spot in interspace 6, thus enclosing a prominent lunule of the groundcolour. Underside as in the male but paler.
The Himalayas, in the outer ranges from Campbellpur in the Punjab to Sikhim; Oudh; Agra; Manbhum in Bengal; Assam, the Khasi Hills; Upper Burma; extending to China and Formosa; Sumatra; Java. Can also be found in southern Japan.
" Head and legs black; body black, this colour, however, obscured by orange-tawny markings. A broad orange-tawny dorsal stripe. Four straight horizontal simple black spines on head; spines on pectoral segments black; on abdominal segments pink tipped with black; on caudal segments pink faintly black-tipped."
"Head and wing-cases pale Indian red; ten pale metallic spots on back; abdomen dark pink; spines faintly black-tipped." (A.

Indian Ocean literature

The Indian Ocean is home to many literary texts, from Greco-Roman times to the Thousand and One nights, the matrix of many narratives, which portrays Sinbad the Merchant, through a fantastic and popular twist of the mind, however based on real details of navigation in this first ocean of globalisation. Indeed, combining Indian and Chinese literatures, among the oldest on the planet, it can be characterized as the most fictionalized ocean, having been the backbone of many tales, novels and poetic work.
This was further enhanced when Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, paving the way for Vasco da Gama, who reached Malindi, before being guided to Calicut, the desired port of spices, by a mualim or regional pilot. The Portuguese poet Camoens then wrote his famous "Luciads".
Mark Twain sojourned there. So did Bernardin de Saint Pierre, who invented the naturalist novel with "Paul et Virginie", an idyllic and tragic novel under the tropics, in Mauritius. Charles Baudelaire also carried his spleen there, experimenting the correspondences and falling in love with Creole and Indian ladies, as expressed in his poems "La dame créole" or "A une malabaraise". In Réunion, Rouget Leconte de Lisle is foremost, with symbolist poetry.
Many more poets went to the Mascarene islands, like Paul-Jean Toulet.
In the colonial era, writers like Rabemananjara and Rabearivelo took French to new horizons, combining their original languages and cultures with the colonist's idiom. In Réunion, Marius and Ary Leblond developed the colonial novel, and in Mauritius, Clément Charoux and Léoville L'Homme expressed the contradictions of cultures and colours in a colonial environment.
Preceding the independence period, Mauritian writers like Marcel Cabon, Jean-Georges Prosper, Edouard Maunick, Robert Edward-Hart, René Noyau and Emmanuel Juste were to espouse négritude or more Mauritian themes.
the ocean poet is barron pilgrim who has the name trademarked and owns the name. has written several books of poetry about life and the ocean.
In the 1970s, more "sociological" writers such Marie-Thérèse Humbert expressed the duality of multiculturalism.
Recent Mauritian writers include Ananda Devi, Natacha Appanah, Carl de Souza, Shenaz Patel, Barlen Pyamootoo and Khal Torabully.

Magnetic tweezers

Magnetic tweezers (MT) are scientific instruments for the manipulation and characterization of biomolecules or polymers. These apparatus exert forces and torques to individual molecules or groups of molecules. It can be used to measure the tensile strength or the force generated by molecules.
Most commonly magnetic tweezers are used to study mechanical properties of biological macromolecules like DNA or proteins in single-molecule experiments. Other applications are the rheology of soft matter, and studies of force-regulated processes in living cells. Forces are typically on the order of pico- to nanonewtons. Due to their simple architecture, magnetic tweezers are a popular biophysical tool.
In experiments, the molecule of interest is attached to a magnetic microparticle. The magnetic tweezer is equipped with magnets that are used to manipulate the magnetic particles whose position is measured with the help of video microscopy.
A magnetic tweezers apparatus consists of magnetic micro-particles, which can be manipulated with the help of an external magnetic field. The position of the magnetic particles is then determined by a microscopic objective with a camera.
Magnetic particles for the operation in magnetic tweezers come with a wide range of properties and have to be chosen according to the intended application. Two basic types of magnetic particles are described in the following paragraphs; however there are also others like magnetic nanoparticles in ferrofluids, which allow experiments inside a cell.
Superparamagnetic beads are commercially available with a number of different characteristics. The most common is the use of spherical particles of a diameter in the micrometer range. They consist of a porous latex matrix in which magnetic nanoparticles have been embedded. Latex is auto-fluorescent and may therefore be advantageous for the imaging of their position. Irregular shaped particles present a larger surface and hence a higher probability to bind to the molecules to be studied. The coating of the microbeads contains also ligands to be able to attach the molecules of interest. For example, the coating may contain streptavidin which couples strongly to biotin, which itself may be bound to the molecules of interest.
When exposed to an external magnetic field, these microbeads become magnetized. The induced magnetic moment formula_1 is proportional to a weak external magnetic field formula_2:
formula_3
where formula_4 is the vacuum permeability. It is also proportional to the volume formula_5 of the microspheres, which stems from the fact that the number of magnetic nanoparticles scales with the size of the bead. The magnetic susceptibility formula_6 is assumed to be scalar in this first estimation and may be calculated by formula_7, where formula_8 is the relative permeability. In a strong external field, the induced magnetic moment saturates at a material dependent value formula_9. The force formula_10 experienced by a microbead can be derived from the potential formula_11 of this magnetic moment in an outer magnetic field:
formula_12
The outer magnetic field can be evaluated numerically with the help of finite element analysis or by simply measuring the magnetic field with the help of a Hall effect sensor. Theoretically it would be possible to calculate the force on the beads with these formulae; however the results are not very reliable due to uncertainties of the involved variables, but they allow estimating the order of magnitude and help to better understand the system. More accurate numerical values can be obtained considering the Brownian motion of the beads.
Due to anisotropies in the stochastic distribution of the nanoparticles within the microbead the magnetic moment is not perfectly aligned with the outer magnetic field i.e. the magnetic susceptibility tensor cannot be reduced to a scalar. For this reason, the beads are also subjected to a torque formula_13which tries to align formula_14 and formula_2:
formula_16
The torques generated by this method are typically much greater than formula_17, which is more than necessary to twist the molecules of interest.
The use of ferromagnetic nanowires for the operation of magnetic tweezers enlarges their experimental application range. The length of these wires typically is in the order of tens of nanometers up to tens of micrometers, which is much larger than their diameter. In comparison with superparamagnetic beads, they allow the application of much larger forces and torques. In addition to that, they present a remnant magnetic moment. This allows the operation in weak magnetic field strengths. It is possible to produce nanowires with surface segments that present different chemical properties, which allows controlling the position where the studied molecules can bind to the wire.
To be able to exert torques on the microbeads at least two magnets are necessary, but many other configurations have been realized, reaching from only one magnet that only pulls the magnetic microbeads to a system of six electromagnets that allows fully controlling the 3-dimensional position and rotation via a digital feedback loop. The magnetic field strength decreases roughly exponentially with the distance from the axis linking the two magnets on a typical scale of about the width of the gap between the magnets. Since this scale is rather large in comparison to the distances, when the microbead moves in an experiment, the force acting on it may be treated as constant. Therefore, magnetic tweezers are passive force clamps due to the nature of their construction in contrast to optical tweezers, although they may be used as position clamps, too, when combined with a feedback loop. The field strength may be increased by sharpening the pole face of the magnet which, however, also diminishes the area where the field may be considered as constant. An iron ring connection the outer poles of the magnets may help to reduce stray fields. Magnetic tweezers can be operated with both, permanent magnets and electromagnets. The two techniques have their specific advantages.
Permanent magnets of magnetic tweezers are usually out of rare earth materials, like neodymium and can reach field strengths exceeding 1.3 Tesla. The force on the beads may be controlled by moving the magnets along the vertical axis. Moving them up decreases the field strength at the position of the bead and vice versa. Torques on the magnetic beads may be exerted by turning the magnets around the vertical axis to change the direction of the field. The size of the magnets is in the order of millimeters as well as their spacing.
The use of electromagnets in magnetic tweezers has the advantage that the field strength and direction can be changed just by adjusting the amplitude and the phase of the current for the magnets. For this reason, the magnets do not need to be moved which allows a faster control of the system and reduces mechanical noise. In order to increase the maximum field strength, a core of a soft paramagnetic material with high saturation and low remanence may be added to the solenoid. In any case, however, the typical field strengths are much lower compared to those of permanent magnets of comparable size. Additionally, using electromagnets requires high currents that produce heat that may necessitate a cooling system.
The displacement of the magnetic beads corresponds to the response of the system to the imposed magnetic field and hence needs to be precisely measured: In a typical set-up, the experimental volume is illuminated from the top so that the beads produce diffraction rings in the focal plane of an objective which is placed under the tethering surface. The diffraction pattern is then recorded by a CCD-camera. The image can be analyzed in real time by a computer. The detection of the position in the plane of the tethering surface is not complicated since it corresponds to the center of the diffraction rings. The precision can be up to a few nanometers. For the position along the vertical axis, the diffraction pattern needs to be compared to reference images, which show the diffraction pattern of the considered bead in a number of known distances from the focal plane. These calibration images are obtained by keeping a bead fixed while displacing the objective, i.e. the focal plane, with the help of piezoelectric elements by known distances. With the help of interpolation, the resolution can reach precision of up 10 nm along this axis. The obtained coordinates may be used as input for a digital feedback loop that controls the magnetic field strength, for example, in order to keep the bead at a certain position.
Non-magnetic beads are usually also added to the sample as a reference to provide a background displacement vector. They have a different diameter as the magnetic beads so that they are optically distinguishable. This is necessary to detect potential drift of the fluid. For example, if the density of magnetic particles is too high, they may drag the surrounding viscous fluid with them. The displacement vector of a magnetic bead can be determined by subtracting its initial position vector and this background displacement vector from its current position.
The determination of the force that is exerted by the magnetic field on the magnetic beads can be calculated considering thermal fluctuations of the bead in the horizontal plane: The problem is rotational symmetric with respect to the vertical axis; hereafter one arbitrarily picked direction in the symmetry plane is called formula_18. The analysis is the same for the direction orthogonal to the x-direction and may be used to increase precision. If the bead leaves its equilibrium position on the formula_19-axis by formula_20 due to thermal fluctuations, it will be subjected to a restoring force formula_21 that increases linearly with formula_20 in the first order approximation. Considering only absolute values of the involved vectors it is geometrically clear that the proportionality constant is the force exerted by the magnets formula_23 over the length formula_24 of the molecule that keeps the bead anchored to the tethering surface:
formula_25.
The equipartition theorem states that the mean energy that is stored in this "spring" is equal to formula_26 per degree of freedom. Since only one direction is considered here, the potential energy of the system reads:
formula_27.
From this, a first estimate for the force acting on the bead can be deduced:
formula_28.
For a more accurate calibration, however, an analysis in Fourier space is necessary. The power spectrum density formula_29 of the position of the bead is experimentally available. A theoretical expression for this spectrum is derived in the following, which can then be fitted to the experimental curve in order to obtain the force exerted by the magnets on the bead as a fitting parameter. By definition this spectrum is the squared modulus of the Fourier transform of the position formula_30 over the spectral bandwidth formula_31:
formula_32
formula_33 can be obtained considering the equation of motion for a bead of mass formula_34:
formula_35
The term formula_36 corresponds to the Stokes friction force for a spherical particle of radius formula_37 in a medium of viscosity formula_38 and formula_39 is the restoring force which is opposed to the stochastic force formula_40 due to the Brownian motion. Here, one may neglect the inertial term formula_41, because the system is in a regime of very low Reynolds number formula_42.
The equation of motion can be Fourier transformed inserting the driving force and the position in Fourier space:
formula_43
This leads to:
formula_44.
The power spectral density of the stochastic force formula_45 can be derived by using the equipartition theorem and the fact that Brownian collisions are completely uncorrelated:
formula_46
This corresponds to the Fluctuation-dissipation theorem. With that expression, it is possible to give a theoretical expression for the power spectrum:
formula_47
The only unknown in this expression, formula_48, can be determined by fitting this expression to the experimental power spectrum. For more accurate results, one may subtract the effect due to finite camera integration time from the experimental spectrum before doing the fit.
Another force calibration method is to use the viscous drag of the microbeads: Therefore, the microbeads are pulled through the viscous medium while recording their position. Since the Reynolds number for the system is very low, it is possible to apply Stokes law to calculate the friction force which is in equilibrium with the force exerted by the magnets:
formula_49.
The velocity formula_50 can be determined by using the recorded velocity values. The force obtained via this formula can then be related to a given configuration of the magnets, which may serve as a calibration.
This section compares the features of magnetic tweezers with those of the most important other single-molecule experimental methods: optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy. The magnetic interaction is highly specific to the used superparamagnetic microbeads. The magnetic field does practically not affect the sample. Optical tweezers have the problem that the laser beam may also interact with other particles of the biological sample due to contrasts in the refractive index. In addition to that, the laser may cause photodamage and sample heating. In the case of atomic force microscopy, it may also be hard to discriminate the interaction of the tip with the studied molecule from other nonspecific interactions.
Thanks to the low trap stiffness, the range of forces accessible with magnetic tweezers is lower in comparison with the two other techniques. The possibility to exert torque with magnetic tweezers is not unique: optically tweezers may also offer this feature when operated with birefringent microbeads in combination with a circularly polarized laser beam.
Another advantage of magnetic tweezers is that it is easy to carry out in parallel many single molecule measurements.
An important drawback of magnetic tweezers is the low temporal and spatial resolution due to the data acquisition via video-microscopy. However, with the addition of a high-speed camera, the temporal and spatial resolution has been demonstrated to reach the Angstrom-level.
This section gives an example for an experiment carried out by Strick, Allemand, Croquette with the help of magnetic tweezers. A double-stranded DNA molecule is fixed with multiple binding sites on one end to a glass surface and on the other to a magnetic micro bead, which can be manipulated in a magnetic tweezers apparatus. By turning the magnets, torsional stress can be applied to the DNA molecule. Rotations in the sense of the DNA helix are counted positively and vice versa. While twisting, the magnetic tweezers also allow stretching the DNA molecule. This way, torsion extension curves may be recorded at different stretching forces. For low forces (less than about 0.5 pN), the DNA forms supercoils, so called plectonemes, which decrease the extension of the DNA molecule quite symmetrically for positive and negative twists. Augmenting the pulling force already increases the extension for zero imposed torsion. Positive twists lead again to plectoneme formation that reduces the extension. Negative twist, however, does not change the extension of the DNA molecule a lot. This can be interpreted as the separation of the two strands which corresponds to the denaturation of the molecule. In the high force regime, the extension is nearly independent of the applied torsional stress. The interpretation is the apparition of local regions of highly overwound DNA. An important parameter of this experiment is also the ionic strength of the solution which affects the critical values of the applied pulling force that separate the three force regimes.

Late Night, Maudlin Street

"Late Night, Maudlin Street" is a song performed by Morrissey on his album "Viva Hate".
At 7:40, the track is by far the longest on "Viva Hate" and one of the longest songs in Morrissey's discography. As with many of the other tracks on the album, "Late Night, Maudlin Street" is set in the 1970s (1972 to be precise) and combines some of Morrissey's most self-pitying lyrics with some of his most humorous. The music is based on the work of Joni Mitchell.
The scene is set in 1972, where amid a background of power cuts and house moves the narrator faces a private battle against ugliness, pill-taking, family deaths and fantasy love. Paradoxically, the greatest moments of nostalgia are reserved for a place where the narrator failed to experience a single happy hour.
The title is an amalgamation of a book of short stories by Bill Naughton called "Late Night on Watling Street" and the name of the school in Carry On Teacher, "Maudlin Street Secondary".
The song was performed live by Morrissey on his 2002 tour.

Pantoporia hordonia

The Common Lascar ("Pantoporia hordonia") is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in tropical and subtropical Asia.
Both male and female have upperside black with orange markings. Fore wing: discoidal streak broad, anteriorly twice indented, at apex extending into base of interspace 3; posterior discal spots coalescent, forming an irregular oblique short broad band ; anterior spots also coalescent, oblique from costa; a postdiscal obscure grey incurved transverse line, and a very slender, also obscure, orange transverse subterminal line. Hind wing: a subbasal transverse broad band, and a much narrower postdiscal band curved inwards at the ends; beyond this the black terminal margin is traversed by a darker black subterminal line. Underside chestnut-brown, covered with short, slender, transverse brown striae on the margin of the orange markings, which are similar to those on the upperside but broader, paler, and less clearly defined. Fore wing : the pale transverse postdiscal and orange subterminal lines of the upperside replaced by a postdiscal lilacine narrow band, defined by somewhat crenulate chestnut-brown lines on each side, and a pale subterminal line. Hind wing: the base suffused with lilacine; the subbasal and postdiscal bands bordered outwardly by narrow lilacine bands, the orange-yellow of the postdiscal band much obscured by the transverse brown strife; the terminal margin with a sinuous obscure broad lilacine line. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black; beneath, the palpi and thorax greyish, abdomen ochraceous.
Males and females are similar to the wet-season form, but the markings are very much broader; on the upperside of the fore wing the postdiscal line generally and the subterminal line always clearly defined, the former sometimes like the latter, orange-yellow, Underside paler, the markings more blurred, the transverse short brown striae in many specimens covering nearly the whole surface of the wings.
Expanse: 38–44 mm
Race "sinuata" Moore (restricted to Sri Lanka) is a slightly differentiated island form. It differs constantly from the typical form in the margins of the discal markings (especially the outer margins) on the upperside of the fore wing and the margins of the subbasal and postdiscal bands of the hind wing being more sinuous.
Continental India, from the Himalayas to the Western Ghats; Assam; Burma; Tenasserim, extending into the Malayan sub-region.
"Has two forms. In the first the head is large and roughly triangular, the segments of the body increase to the fourth and then diminish gradually, and the third, fourth, sixth, and twelfth have each two obtuse dorsal points. The fore part from the fourth segment is generally inclined downwards at an angle with the rest of the body and is with the underpays of a dark greenish-brown colour. The rest is just that shade of greenish-grey which the leaves assume when withered, and is crossed by diagonal dark bands exactly representing the spaces between the leaflets as a painter would paint them – a most perfect disguise. The second form of the larva differs in having the head furcate, while the dorsal points are replaced by long spine-like processes. The figure will give a better idea of the difference than any description ... The butterfly resulting from the larva with spines has a light male-mark; that resulting from the other a dark male-mark ... The two forms of larva are never found together; the smooth type of caterpillar is often found in quantities on one bush ... the smooth caterpillar feeds on "Acacia" and "Albizzia", the spined one has never been found on any plant but "Acacia"."(Davidson, Bell and Aitken)

Ken Jay

Kenneth "Ken Jay" Lacey (born June 10, 1966) is an American musician, best known as the original drummer for Static-X.
Jay was born in Jamaica, Illinois. Ken began playing drums early on and had played drums in a couple of metal bands early in his career in central Illinois before heading north to Chicago. Ken was the drummer in Deep Blue Dream, a band that also included Wayne Static and had auditioned at one point for Smashing Pumpkins but was told by Billy Corgan he was "too metal" to be in the band. He co-founded Static-X with Wayne Static in 1994. Ken played drums on the band's first two albums, "Wisconsin Death Trip" and "Machine", but before Static-X could begin recording their third album, "Shadow Zone", Jay left the band because of musical and political differences.
Shortly after his departure, he joined Godhead as a replacement drummer for a brief time. He has kept out of the media limelight since his departure.
In 2010, Ken stepped back into music to produce the debut album for Texas-based band, Blood Red Summer. He connected with the band through their guitar player, Erik Fincher, who had worked with Ken at a Virgin Records store in Los Angeles, CA, and later became Static-X's long time guitar tech.

Vincenzo Bianchini

Vincenzo Bianchini (Viterbo, 1903 – Geneva, 2000) was a doctor, painter, sculptor, writer, poet and philosopher.
After studying classics and music at Viterbo, he enrolled in the faculty of political sciences at Florence, shortly before moving to Rome to study medicine.
Married, graduated, he entered military service but went to the Ethiopian War as a doctor, seeking to experience life to the full.
On his return he was a doctor in the municipality of Rome, in Fiumicino and the Caffarelletta quarter, where he had his first contact with the desolation and misery of the poor, prompting his first participation in anti-fascist Resistance (with his brother-in-law, the resistance leader Mariano Buratti). Later he worked in the mines of Ingurtosu in Sardinia.
In 1951 he left for Iran, to participate in an Italian aid project for the Persian population. For more than ten years, he dedicated himself to assisting villagers in the most isolated regions, organizing among other things a small hospital in Kurdistan and services at Sericiabad, where he lived for two years.
On the behest of the WHO he went to the Congo after the civil war of 1961, staying there till 1965–66. In 1966 he travelled to Algeria but returned to Iran where he continued practising and painting until the Revolution of 1979.
A Renaissance man and avant-gardiste, through multiple outlets of expression throughout his life and above all through his dedicated work with "forgotten" peoples, he has sought to valorise and make known their humanity, suffering and dignity. He has expressed his thoughts through sculpture, ceramics, and paintings as well as through poetry and novels. Some of his sculptures can be seen in buildings in Tehran and in Algeria.
He has published numerous books (poetry and prose) in Italian and English, most of them out of print:

Logarithmically concave measure

In mathematics, a Borel measure "μ" on "n"-dimensional Euclidean space formula_1 is called logarithmically concave (or log-concave for short) if, for any compact subsets "A" and "B" of formula_1 and 0 < "λ" < 1, one has
where "λ" "A" + (1 − "λ") "B" denotes the Minkowski sum of "λ" "A" and (1 − "λ") "B".
The Brunn–Minkowski inequality asserts that the Lebesgue measure is log-concave. The restriction of the Lebesgue measure to any convex set is also log-concave.
By a theorem of Borell, a measure is log-concave if and only if it has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on some affine hyperplane, and this density is a logarithmically concave function. Thus, any Gaussian measure is log-concave.
The Prékopa–Leindler inequality shows that a convolution of log-concave measures is log-concave.

C. W. W. Kannangara

Christopher William Wijekoon Kannangara (Sinhala:සි.ඩබ්ලිව්.ඩබ්ලිව්.කන්නන්ගර;13 October 1884 – 23 September 1969) was a Sri Lankan lawyer and politician. Rising up the ranks of Sri Lanka's movement for independence in the early part of the 20th century, he became the first Minister of Education in the State Council of Ceylon, and was instrumental in introducing extensive reforms to the country's education system that opened up education to children from all levels of society.
Born in rural town in Balapitiya, South, Sri Lanka, his academic prowess enabled him to win a scholarship to Richmond College, Galle, a prestigious national school at the time. Initially working as a lawyer after leaving school, he entered politics as the movement for independence was gathering strength in Sri Lanka. Kannangara was first elected to the Ceylon Legislative Council in 1923 and then to the State Council. He also served as the President of the Ceylon National Congress.
As Minister of Education in the State Council, Kannangara introduced extensive reforms to the education system of Sri Lanka throughout the 1940s. They befitted thousands of underprivileged students in rural parts of the country by making education free for all students. He also began a Central Colleges scheme, which established high quality secondary schools in rural areas of the country. Kannangara's significant achievements in areas of education have led him to being commonly referred to as the "Father of Free Education in Sri Lanka".
Crestoper William Wijekoon Kannangara was born on 13 October 1884, in Randombe, a rural village at Balapitiya in the south of Sri Lanka.<ref name='st-10/8/06-groe'></ref> The son of John Daniel Wijekoon Kannangara, the Deputy Fiscal Officer in the Balapitiya Courts, and Emily Wijesinghe, he had his primary education at the Wesleyan Missionary School in Randombe.<ref name='dn-9/24/03'></ref>
Kannangara showed great educational promise as a child, and his achievements were recognised by Rev. J.H Darrel, the Principal of Richmond College, Galle who was the chief guest at a prize giving of the Wesleyan Missionary School. After noticing that Kannangara won most of the available prizes, he is said to have remarked "Son, you may have to hire a bullock cart to take home the books you collected at this prize giving."<ref name='dm-9/20/06'></ref> Darrel also gave Kannangara a chance to sit for a Richmond College Foundation scholarship exam. Excelling in Mathematics in the exam, he won the scholarship, receiving an award for free board and lodging at Richmond College. There he received the education of an elite school of the times, far superior instructions to that offered at his rural school.
Kannangara was regarded as an excellent all-round student at Richmond, leading the Ceylon and British Empire list in Mathematics at the Cambridge Senior Examination in 1903. He also captained Richmond College in first eleven cricket in 1903, and was a member of the school soccer team the same year, winning colours for his performances. He was also regarded as a fine debater and actor. After leaving school, he taught Mathematics first at Richmond College and then Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa and Wesley College, Colombo. While teaching he studied law, passing out as an Attorney at law in 1910. He set up his first law practice in Galle the same year. He married Edith Weerasooriya in 1922.
Kannangara joined Anagarika Dharmapala's historically significant temperance movement, and worked actively with its leaders, including Sir D.B. Jayatilleke, D.S. Senanayake, F.R. Senanayake and Arthur V. Dias. He rose to national prominence as a lawyer defending leaders of the Sri Lankan independence movement and others who were persecuted by the colonial British administration during the period of martial law which following the Riots of 1915. This also drew him into national politics, and in 1923 he entered the Legislative Council of Ceylon, winning a by-election on 13 April 1923 for a seat in the Galle District made vacant by the demise of O.C. Tillekaratne by 1969 votes to 115. He was re-elected the following year polling 4,177 votes, opposed to 2310 for his nearest opponent.<ref name='dn-10/15/03-bor'></ref> Following the recommendations of the Donoughmore Commission, the State Council was established in 1931, succeeding the Legislative Council as the national legislature. Kannangara was elected to the State Council in 1931 and again in 1936. He also became the President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1931.
For the first time, the State Council, which had its members elected via universal suffrage, compromised Executive Committees and Ministers. Kannangara was appointed as the first chairman of the Executive Committee of Education in the State Council and thus became the first Minister of Education of Sri Lanka in 1931. Apart from Kannangara, the Executive Committee of Education consisted of H. W. Amarasuriya, W.T.B. Karaliyadda, A. Ratnayaka G.R. De Zoysa, P.E. Madawela and Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe. He is also notable for being the first minister to wear the National costume in the State Council. During World War II, he was a member of the War Council.
Executive Committee of Education exercised its powers to create new regulations paving the way for the establishment of a new system of education in Sri Lanka. The new system was expected to ensure that education was provided with equal opportunities for all children in the country, irrespective of social class, economic condition, religion and ethnic origin. Whilst the education in vernacular schools had been free prior to the reforms due to government grants to cover the cost of teaching and local philanthropists providing the buildings, equipment and the books, it was not standardised. In 1942 a special committee was appointed with Kannangara as chairman to report on the status of education in the country. Among the recommendations for providing "lasting value to the nation" given in the report, which was published in 1943, were that
As Minister of Education Kannagara was placed in charge of implementing the recommendations. Among the reforms he introduced, which came into operation on 1 October 1945, were to make education free of charge for all students, to ensure that every student was provided with instruction in the religion of his/her parents, to prevent teachers from been exploited by managers of schools by having their wages paid directly by the government and to make adequate provisions for adult education in the country.
He also established a series of central schools ("Madhya Vidhyala"), modelled on Royal College, Colombo, in locations outside major cities. These took high quality secondary education to the rural outstations of the country. His objective was to create a central school in every electorate in the country, and as such, while in 1941 there were three central schools in the country; by 1945 the number had increased to 35, and to 50 by 1950. First Central College established in Akuramboda, Matale.In 1943 Kannangara also launched an annual scholarship program, which provided the opportunity for the 20 best performers of the scholarship exam to get free board and lodging in Central School hostels.
During his 16-year period as Minister of Education, he also upgraded ancient pirivenas, educational establishments for Buddhist monks, and established the University of Ceylon, the first University in Sri Lanka. Further, Kannangara took steps to abolish the two tier school system, where English was taught to privileged students and the vernacular language was taught to the rural masses. While he laid emphasis on teaching "Swabasha" (native languages) in schools, he also advised that students should learn English to compete in the modern world.
Kannangara however faced significant opposition to his move to establish free education in the country, especially from socially and economically privileged groups who has enjoyed the significant advantages offered to them by the British. Significantly, this included a number of C.W.W Kannangara's political colleagues, including D.S. Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. Kannangara spoke for six and a half hours to convince other members of the council to vote for the bill, and was supported in his efforts by H. W. Amarasuriya, Dudley Senanayake, J. R. Jayewardene, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke and Dr. N. M. Perera. There was also a public campaign launched by Dr. E. W. Adikaram, Professor G.P. Malalasekera and Mr. L. H. Metthananda to support the bill, which was eventually passed in the State Council in July 1945.
Hon. C.W.W.Kannangara's strong interests were not confined only to the spread of free education. He was a strong supporter of the cause to spread Buddhism in the West then gaining increasing public support in Sri Lanka in the immediate post - independence period. At a Public Meeting held at Ananda College, Colombo on May 30, 1953 which was presided by Hon. C.W.W.Kannangara, then Minister of Local Government, to make public the findings of the survey carried out by Asoka Weeraratna (Founder and Hony. Secretary of the Lanka Dhammaduta Society - later known as the German Dharmaduta Society )on the current state of Buddhist activities in Germany and the prospects for a Buddhist Mission to Germany before the Buddha Jayanthi celebrations in 1956, Hon. C.W.W. Kannangara moved the following Motion: " This House is of the opinion that the public of Ceylon should fully support the efforts of the Lanka Dhammaduta Society for the establishment of the Sambuddhasasana in Germany and propagate Buddhism in Europe ". The Hon. C.W.W.Kannangara further said that the Lanka Dhammaduta Society was going to serve one of the greatest causes of Buddhism launched after the Great Emperor Asoka of India. He therefore urged that all Buddhists should back the Society in every way in order to help it to establish the Buddhasasana firmly in Germany He showed his unstinting support for the cause of Buddhist missionary work in the West by attending several of the public meetings of this Society namely the launch of the One Million Rupee Fund (Dasa Laksha Aramudala) held at the Colombo Town Hall on September 6, 1954 which was presided by Hon. Dudley Senanayake (then an ex Prime Minister of Ceylon) and the opening of the new Headquarters of the German Dharmaduta Society at 417, Bullers Road, Colombo 07, by Hon. S.W.R.D Bandaranaike, then Prime Minister of Ceylon, on August 7, 1956.
Hon. C.W.W. Kannangara, in his capacity as the Minister of Local Government attended the opening ceremony of the Sixth Buddhist Council in Rangoon, Burma which commenced on May 17, 1954 and he read out the Message of Right Hon. Sir John Kotelawala, then Prime Minister of Ceylon, welcoming the inauguration of the Sixth Buddhist Council.
His achievements in parliament in the field of Education did not however translate to popularity among the people of his electorate, and he lost his seat in parliament in the General Elections of 1947. Ironically he was defeated in the poll for the Matugama electorate by Wilmot A. Perera, the founder of the popular local school Sri Palee College.
Hon. C.W.W.Kannangara was then appointed Ambassador to Indonesia, a post in which he served from 1950 to 1952. He returned to politics again, and was elected to parliament from the Agalawatta Electorate in 1952, defeating S.A. Silva. He was appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government in the new cabinet. He was most possibly denied the position of Cabinet Minister of Education as some leading figures in the government did not wish to give him the opportunity to carry forward further reforms to the education system.
C.W.W. Kannangara retired from active politics in 1956, and died on 23 September 1969. His remains were cremated according to traditional Buddhist rites at the Anderson Golf Links which later became the site of the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 07. There are a number of institutions named after him in Sri Lanka.
A statue of C. W. W. Kannangara has been erected at the Parakramabahu Central College" in Polgahawela.
A new book under the title ‘No Pearl of Greater Price’ being a biography of C.W.W Kannangara written by the erudite Buddhist Scholar Dr. Ananda Guruge was released on December 28, 2013 at a public meeting held at the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress Auditorium

Kala pani (taboo)

The Kala Pani (literally, black water) represents the taboo of the sea in Indian culture. According to this taboo, crossing the seas causes the loss of one's varna status.
The offense of crossing the sea is also known as "Samudrolanghana" or "Sagarollanghana". The Dharma Sutra of Baudhayana (II.1.2.2) lists sea voyages as first of the offences that cause the loss of varna. The Dharma Sutra suggests a person can wipe away this offense in three years by eating little at every fourth meal time; bathing at dawn, noon and dusk; standing during the day; and seated during the night.
The reasons behind the taboo include the inability to carry out the daily rituals and the sin of contact with the mlecchas. The fear of crossing the seas also derives from the notion that it entailed the end of the reincarnation cycle, as the traveler was cut off from the regenerating waters of the Ganges. Such voyages also meant breaking family and social ties. According to another belief in the pre-modern India, the Kala Pani (sea water) was inhabited by the "hougli"s, bad spirits and monsters.
During the Age of Discovery, the Portuguese sailors noted that the Hindus were reluctant to engage in maritime trade due to this taboo. In the eighteenth century, the banias of North India considered even the crossing of the Indus river at Attock as a taboo, and underwent purification rituals upon their return. However, not all Hindus adhered to the taboo, and there were several Hindu merchants in Burma, Muscat and other places.
The East India Company recruited several upper-caste soldiers, and adapted its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, the overseas service, considered polluting to their caste, was not required of them.
During the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26), the Bengal Army was ordered to go to Chittagong. Since no bullock carts were available and since the sea voyage was a taboo, the Indian soldiers were asked to march to Chittagong by land. The soldiers were concerned about the difficulty involved in a land march, and were also afraid that their superiors might force them to take a sea voyage if the march failed. As a result of these fears, the 47th Regiment refused to march. This resulted in a mutiny on 2 November 1824 at Barrackpore.
The General Services Enlistment Act of 1856 required the new recruits to serve overseas, if asked. The serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that this requirement would be eventually extended to them. Thus, the Hindu soldiers viewed the Act as a potential threat to their faith. The resulting discontent was one of the causes of the Indian rebellion of 1857.
Cellular Jail, the British Indian prison on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was known as Kala Pani: an incarceration in this jail threatened the convicts with the loss of caste and the resulting social exclusion.
When slavery was abolished in British colonies (such as Mauritius in 1834), the authorities looked for indentured labor to replace the slaves who had been emancipated. The emissaries sent to India for this purpose were astute in attracting so-called "coolies" to the countries such as South Africa, Mauritius, Fiji and the Caribbean that requiring cheap labor, which were often presented as "promised lands." But many prospective candidates for the distant colonies expressed their fears of crossing the Kala Pani. So the British often employed a stratagem to dispel the doubts of the indentured: they placed water from the Ganges in large cauldrons on the ships, to ensure the continuity of reincarnation beyond the Kala Pani. The sea voyage was then seen as less fearsome.
The Kala Pani theme features prominently in the Indo-Caribbean history, and has been elaborately discussed in the writings of V. S. Naipaul. Mauritian poet and critic Khal Torabully, who is partly of Indo-Mauritian descent, describes the Kala Pani as a source not only of the dissolution of identity, but also of beauty and reconstruction, leading to what he terms a "coral imaginary."
The Tirupati Temple does not allow a priest who has crossed the seas to enter the temple's sanctum sanctorum.
In 2007, the ascension of Sugunendra Tirtha to the Udupi Krishna Temple was opposed by some seers, because he had visited foreign countries, thus committing the offence of "saagarolanga" (crossing the sea). In 2008, a court verdict formally allowed his ascension. In 2012, both he and his opponent Vishwesha Teertha announced fasts to pressure each other on the issue.
Vishnunarayanan Namboothiri, a noted poet who served as a priest at the Sreevallabha Temple, was not allowed to enter the temple after he returned from an overseas trip to London. The temple authorities, led by the thantri (chief priest), asked him to go a thorough cleansing, penance and "punaravrodha" (reinstallation) before he would be allowed in again. Namboothiri was asked to purify himself by reciting the Gayatri Mantra 1008 times, which he refused to do. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh supported him, calling the taboo an "outdated ritual". The Travancore Devaswom Board also supported him, and fired two of its officials for refusing to his reinstatement. After the board served the thantri a show-cause notice, Namboothiri was allowed back after purification by sprinkling of holy water (theertham).

Slow drag (dance)

The Slow drag is an American ragtime jazz musical form and the social dance for which the music was written. It has been resurrected as part of blues dancing. Music written for the dance is often short-handed into the song title as a "Drag"
Slow drag or "Drag" has a history both in the music written for the dance, and the dance itself. The music has endured in many jazz standards, while the dance as it was originally performed has all but faded from modern performance.
Ragtime composers, including Scott Joplin, Fats Waller, Jelly Roll Morton and others, wrote a number of slow-tempo tunes appropriate for the dance.
A cornetist who played during the 1890s described the music where the Slow drag was done, in the "less fashionable groups in town", as "more raggy" than the music that was played for the more "high-toned" dances. "They did the Slow drag all over Louisiana."
Slow drag was one of ten dance themes Joplin included in "The Ragtime Dance." "The Ragtime Dance" was written in 1899 and consisted of a vocal introduction followed by a series of dance themes introduced by a vocalist.
<poem>"Let me see you do the rag-time dance,
Turn left and do the cakewalk prance,
Turn the other way and do the slow drag -
Now take you lady to the World's Fair
And do the rag-time dance."</poem>
"The Ragtime Dance" was performed once in Sedalia in 1903 with four couples dressed in their own most festive clothing performing the steps to Joplin on the piano playing with a small orchestra.
Joplin also included a Slow drag in his opera "Treemonisha", also choreographing the work. His "Directions for the Slow drag" were:
Another Joplin composition, written with Scott Hayden, is "Sun Flower Slow drag", written in 1901.
Sheet music published in 1906 juxtaposes rural blacks with the music in "The Watermelon Trust; A slow drag" written by Harry Thompson. "A down home shout; Characteristic slow-drag two step" by Herman Carle was published in 1907.
Fats Waller recorded Viper's Drag, a popular slow drag song of its day that was a slow-tempo stride piano tune which has been played by practitioners of the art of stride over the decades, and revived for the Grammy-nominated 1980 Progressive album "Two-Handed Stride" by modern stride pianist Judy Carmichael.
In the late 1930s Jelly Roll Morton's music was considered old-fashioned and obsolete. Morton recorded "Slow Drag" ragtime songs that were by then out of step with mainstream jazz by the time Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines recorded together in 1928. Morton's creole melodies and rhythms are closely connected to the Caribbean, with its mixture of African, French, Spanish and Mexican people.
"The Dream" (c. 1880) is a slow drag, whorehouse number; popular with the musicians of the generation before Morton. They called it "Spanish" because of its tango or habanera beat. The habanera had previously arrived in the Caribbean from West Africa.
"They would just hang onto each other and just grind back and forth in one spot all night".
Another description of the dance, by a woman born in the 1890s was "hanging on each other and barely moving."
In the decades that followed, it spread throughout the American South and was most popular in semi-rural juke joints, where it was danced to the blues. Buster Pickens, who was born in 1916, described people doing the slow drag to "slow low-down dirty blues" in barrelhouse joints.
In 1929, the slow drag became the first African American social dance to be introduced to Broadway audiences, in the play "Harlem".
One description of the dance as performed in the play was "a couple dance in which a man and a woman press their bodies tightly together in a smooth bump and grind as they kept the rhythm of the music". It scandalized white critics with its raw sensuality. Many members of the black community were incensed by this picture of the underside of black urban life.
The intimacy of the Slow drag never garnered it the popularity of other dances derived from African American dance forms, such as the Charleston. Few films of the dance survive.
Dancers from Philadelphia stated that the dance was often used to announce a special relationship between the couples who danced it, "you didn't just slow drag with anyone."
The "cling and sway" characteristic of the slow drag reappeared in rock and roll movies from the late 1950s, when intimate public dancing with more sexual overtones became more socially acceptable. It was also popular in the 1960s when dancing without touching was more popular than "partner dancing", and remains popular. In these cases it is referred to as "slow dancing".
The swing revival helped renew interest in the slow drag. A version of the slow drag is taught today in blues dancing.

Plabennec

Plabennec () is a commune in the Finistère department of Brittany in north-western France.
The area around Plabennec has been occupied since Neolithic times and into the Bronze Age. The commune of Plabennec was formed around the 6th century by a Breton, Saint Abennec. Its name comes from a portmanteau of two Breton language words, "Plou" and "Abennec", which translates as Parish of Saint Abennec.
The land in the area is especially good for growing crops. Since the 19th century, things such as linen, hemp and wheat have been grown locally. In more recent times, with the advancement of agriculture, the land has started to be used for potato growing.
Inhabitants of Plabennec are called in French "Plabennecois".
In 2008, 13.88% of primary-school children in Plabennec attended bilingual schools.
Since the 1960s a lot has changed in the economy of the area. The popularity of new vehicles and mechanicalisation of farming has led to certain professions, such as blacksmiths and saddlers, disappearing. However, many people are now moving to the area to live in the revamped barns and lodges.
Most money in the area comes from tourism (due to the fact it is only 10km from Brest Bretagne Airport), industry, hand-crafted goods and agriculture.
Plabennec is home to Championnat de France de football National side Stade Plabennecois, who play at the Stade de Kervéguen in the commune. The club also deals with other sports such as basketball, handball and volleyball.
Plabennec has been twinned with Waltenhofen in Germany since 1976.

Ethan Tecumseh Vishniac (born 1955) is an American astrophysicist. He is the son of microbiologist Wolf V. Vishniac, and grandson of photographer Roman Vishniac. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Astrophysical Journal and a professor of Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University, after holding positions at University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, University of Texas in Austin, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. His wife Ilene Busch-Vishniac, the ninth president of the University of Saskatchewan (2012-2014), was previously Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Johns Hopkins, and provost and vice-president (academic) of McMaster University from 2007 until 2012.
His best known scientific work is the study of instabilities in expanding blast waves. In Vishniac (1983), he demonstrated that a blast wave expanding in a sufficiently compressible medium would be subject to a linear overstability growing as the square root of time. This is usually known as the Vishniac instability, and generally occurs in any thin enough slab bounded by a shock on one side and a contact discontinuity to a higher temperature region on the other. In Vishniac (1994) he then demonstrated that a thin-enough slab bounded by shocks on both sides is subject to a nonlinear instability, usually described as a nonlinear thin shell instability (NTSI).
He has also worked with success in cosmology and the theory of astrophysical dynamos.

He underwent a trial with Turkish club Kasımpaşa SK, but Özdoğan thought the contract offered was suspicious, and did not sign with the club. He unsuccessfully trialled with Danish 1st Division club Viborg FF, before moving back to childhood club BK Avarta in the Danish 2nd Division for the Spring of 2012. In August 2012, Özdoğan moved to rival 2nd Division club Svebølle B&I.
He has played 26 games and scored a single goal for various Danish youth national teams. He made his debut for the Danish under-16 national team in January 2006, and played two matches for the team and scored a goal. In September 2006, he was called up for the Danish under-17 national team.

Danger Within

Danger Within is a 1959 British war film set in a prisoner of war camp in Northern Italy during the summer of 1943. A combination of POW escape drama and whodunnit, the movie is based upon the novel "Death in Captivity" by Michael Gilbert, who had been a prisoner of war, held by the Italians.
A cleverly planned escape attempt, which seemed guaranteed to work, ends in disaster: the would-be escapee is caught and killed by sadistic Capitano Benucci (Peter Arne) within seconds of leaving the POW camp. This incident is witnessed by the other prisoners, who notice that Benucci seemed to be waiting for the escapee to arrive before shooting him dead in cold blood.
Afterwards, the escape committee led by Lieutenant Colonel David Baird (Richard Todd) are convinced that there is an informer within their ranks. The prime suspect is a Greek officer, Lieutenant Coutoules (Cyril Shaps). However, when Coutoules is found dead in an escape tunnel, suspicions that there is a traitor living among the POWs die down. In an effort to explain away his death to the Italian captors, Coutoules' body is placed in an abandoned escape tunnel within the camp and the Italians are informed he was suffocated by a roof fall.
Based on the flimsiest of evidence, Benucci charges Captain Roger Byfold (Donald Houston) with the murder of Coutoules. It is obvious to the POWs that although Byfold is completely innocent, Benucci will ensure that he is found guilty and executed. The escape committee forms a desperate plan to get Byfold and two other officers (played by Peter Jones and Michael Wilding) out of the camp before Byfold goes on trial. The three POWs scale the camp fence with a ladder constructed from two rugby posts. Unfortunately, Benucci and his men are concealed just outside the fence with a machinegun mounted on the back of a truck, and promptly mow them all down. This is the second occasion on which Benucci has deliberately killed escaping POWs in cold blood, when it would have been very easy to capture them alive, instead. The POW escape committee realise that Benucci knew exactly when and where the three POWs planned to escape, and that he had positioned himself in the best place to ambush them. The only logical explanation is that there genuinely is a traitor among the POWs who has betrayed them by passing information to Benucci. This also means that Benucci must already know about another tunnel they are working on, intended for a mass escape of POWs. The prisoners realise that Benucci could easily intervene to prevent the next escape attempt from taking place, if he wanted to. However, Benucci prefers to let preparations continue for sinister reasons: the informer is certain to pass on the date and time of the escape, allowing Benucci to wait at the other end of the tunnel with a machinegun to shoot as many POWs as he can.
The race is then on to find the informer and for the rest of the inmates to escape en masse before the camp is handed over to the Germans as part of the Italian Armistice. The escape plan devised by Lieutenant Colonel Huxley (Bernard Lee) is for the prisoners to make their escape during the day, under cover of a production of "Hamlet" in the theatre hut by a group of POWs led by Captain Rupert Callender (Dennis Price). Benucci would never imagine that the POWs will try to escape in broad daylight, which is precisely why the POWs intend to do it.
Locations for the film were Chobham Common, Surrey and Shepperton Studios.
The film was retitled "Breakout" for the US market.

Cyrestis thyodamas

The Common Map ("Cyrestis thyodamas") is a species of nymphalid butterfly found in South Asia and Southeast Asia.
Males and females upperside white, in many specimens pale ochraceous yellow, veins black. Fore wing with four very slender irregularly sinuous transverse black lines, the costal margin shaded with ochraceous at base and fuscous beyond; cell crossed by three or four additional line short lines; a postdiscal very incomplete series of white-centred broad fuscous rings in the interspaces, tinged with ochraceous near the tornus and broadly interrupted in interspaces 3 and 4 ; beyond this two transverse black lines not reaching the dorsal margin, shaded with fuscous between; the apex broadly and the termen also shaded with fuscous. Hind wing with three transverse fine lines; a pair of postdiscal broad black lines shaded with light sepia-brown between, forming a conspicuous band, the outer line broken and incomplete, followed by two irregular line black lines, a subterminal more pronounced black line, and posteriorly a narrow black terminal margin ; dorsal margin broadly fuscous at base; apical half and the tornal area and lobe rich ochraceous, with some sepia-brown and black markings. Underside similar, the markings of the upperside showing through by transparency; the ochraceous shading on dorsum and tornal area on hind wing of less extent, but the tornal lobe darker ochraceous with a central large round black spot. The markings both on upper and under sides vary a little in depth of colour and breadth. In many specimens there is a diffuse fuscous spot between the discal pair of transverse fine lines on fore wing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen above black, thorax and abdomen with lateral greyish longitudinal stripes : beneath white. .Body of the female paler than that of the male.
Race "andamanica", Very closely resembles the typical form ; the dark markings, however, are as a rule heavier and more pronounced, but in this some specimens from the Anaimalai Hills approximate very closely to the lighter coloured Andaman individuals. One constant point of difference, however, seems to be the large amount of rich ochraceous colour on the upperside of the hind wing posteriorly. The costal margin and the postdiscal series of rings on the fore wing are also strongly tinged with ochraceous. Apparently common at Port Blair.
Expanse 58–70 mm.
"Mr. Bell noticed a female on the 10th October depositing its eggs on the tenderest leaves and buds of a banian tree and secured six, of which two were reared. The eggs were curious and beautiful, high domed-shaped or almost conical, with an aperture at the top fitted with a deeply dentate flat cap like a cogged wheel. The larva escaped by raising this and did not eat the shell. The larva was unlike any other that, we have ever seen, slender, cylindrical and smooth ; with two long curved divergent filaments or soft horns on the head, a single at outer sword-shaped one on the back at the 5th or 6th segment curved backwards and serrated on its inner edge, and another on the last segment curved forwards and serrated on its outer edge. The colour was a fine reddish brown with a broad green band on the side from the 5th to the last segment."
"Suspended by the tail, very much compressed, with a dorsal ridge from head to tail, high and obtusely pointed in the middle, the palpi-cases united and produced into a long somewhat recurved snout; colour brown with fine dark striae." (Davidson & Aitken)
It has been recorded as a migrant in South India and is known to mud-puddle.
Continental India generally, from the Himalayas to Travancore, in the hills, avoiding the hot dry plains of Northern and Central India; Assam;Manipur; Burma; Tenasserim ;Kumaun himalaya extending to China and Japan. A subspecies is present on Taiwan.

Eläintarha

Eläintarha () is a large park in central Helsinki, Finland. The name "eläintarha" means "zoo".
The park's location acts as a divisor between the districts of Töölö to the west, and Hakaniemi and Kallio to the east. The southern half of the park includes two bays of the Baltic Sea: Töölönlahti to the west, and Eläintarhanlahti to the east. The railroad tracks running northwards from the Helsinki Central railway station run between these bays, effectively splitting the Eläintarha park in half.
At the north-western end of the park, near the district of Laakso, is the Eläintarha Stadium, or "Eltsu" in slang. From 1932 to 1963, the Eläintarha arena hosted annual motorbike and racing car races, known as Eläintarhanajot or "Eltsunajot", but these were later cancelled as too dangerous.
Contrary to the name, there has never been a zoo in Eläintarha. There are two theories for the misleading name. The more popular one is that Henrik Borgström, who bought the park area in the middle of the 19th century, had announced plans to build a zoo there, and by the 1880s, the name Eläintarha had been established in advance, anticipating the zoo, which never materialised. The city of Helsinki bought the park from Borgström in 1877. Another theory is that the name is simply a translation from the Djurgården park in Stockholm, Sweden.
The real Helsinki zoo is located on the island of Korkeasaari.
The landscape of Töölönlahti in Eläintarha is portrayed in the famous painting The Wounded Angel by Finnish symbolist painter Hugo Simberg.

Galle Face Green

The Galle Face is a five hectare ocean-side urban park, which stretches for a half kilometre along the coast, in the heart of the financial and business district of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The promenade was initially laid out in 1859 by Governor Sir Henry George Ward, although the original Galle Face Green extended over a much larger area than is seen today. The Galle Face Green was initially used for horse racing and as a golf course, but was also used for cricket, polo, football, tennis and rugby.
Galle Face Green originally extended over a much larger area than exists today. Records indicate that it was bounded to the north by Beira Lake, the ramparts of Colombo Fort and the city’s cemetery, to the west by the Indian Ocean, whilst to the south by the Galle Face Hotel (established in 1864, although the original building on the site was a Dutch villa) and to the east by St Peter's Church (consecrated in 1821). The Galle Face Green was initially laid out by the Dutch as a means to enable their cannons a strategic line of fire against the Portuguese. One version of how the name Galle Face is derived, is that it is from the original Dutch name for the fortifications, in that the gateway which gave access to the Colombo Fort was called the "Gal Gate", as it faced southwards to Galle and "faas" means front, so it literally means in front of the fortification that faced toward Galle. Another version is it is a corruption of the original name for the area's rocky shoreline, Gal Bokka, "Gal" being the Sinhalese for rock and that "Gal Gate" actually meant rock gate.
In 1856 the then Governor of British Ceylon, Sir Henry George Ward (1797–1860) authorised the construction of a promenade along the oceanside of the Galle Face Green, for ladies and children to saunter and ‘take in the air’. The promenade was subsequently completed in 1859.
Horse racing began in Galle Face in the early 1820s, during the time of the then British Governor Sir Edward Barnes (1776–1838). The esplanade in front of the fort, previously a marshy area, was filled with earth and levelled for the purpose. The race course was approximately one and a half miles long. The area became known as the Colpetty Race Course, and was used for horse races until 1893 when horse racing moved to the Colombo Racecourse. The Turf and Sporting Club was also founded in the early 1820s, with the first officially recorded horse racing meet held on the Green in the 1821.
In order to view the races a pavilion was erected at the highest point of the green, it was circular in shape, with wooden framework and a thatched cadjan roof. As the years went by, the pavilion building was improved, with wooden walls replaced by bricks and made larger. A more spacious building, known as the ‘Race Bungalow’, was subsequently built on the same spot. In September 1870 a viewing gallery was added, which came to be called the ‘Grand Stand’. Later a two storey grandstand was built for members. In 1870 the Race Bungalow became the venue for the Colombo Club and since then it was referred to as the Colombo Club building. This building still stands today, with all its colonial grandeur, and is now the Crystal Ballroom of Taj Samudra Hotel.
In 1879, a number of British expatriates introduced golf to Ceylon playing on the Galle Face Green. It was there that they inaugurated the Colombo Golf Club without a clubhouse or a proper golf course. The club had its first Annual General Meeting on 13 March 1880 at the Colombo Club. in 1896 Galle Face was becoming more and more crowded and the golf club faced with having to share the ground with numerous other sports and the general public moved to its present location in Borella.
On 30 June 1879 the first official rugby match in Ceylon was played at Galle Face Green between the newly formed Colombo Football Club and a rest of the world team. Rugby matches were then regularly played in the center of the Colpetty race track, an area shared with the golf club.
The first Royal–Thomian cricket match played between Royal College, Colombo (at that time called Colombo Academy) and S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia was played on 15-17 July 1879 at Galle Face Green, which is today the site of the Taj Samudra Hotel. It was said that the two teams had to row across the Beira Lake in boats to reach the Galle Face Grounds. Colombo Academy won the inaugural encounter by 56 runs.
The Galle Face Green is currently a 5 hectare ribbon strip of land between Galle Road and the Indian Ocean which is now the largest open space in Colombo. This is a popular destination for children, vendors, teenagers, lovers, kite flyers, merrymakers and all those who want to indulge in their favorite pastimes next to the sea under the open sky. On Saturday and Sunday evenings, the land is busy with day trippers, picnickers and food vendors. There are two large hotels that border the strip; the Ceylon Inter-Continental Hotel and at the other by the quaint Galle Face Hotel, one of Sri Lanka's oldest and most popular hotels, with a variety of old world charm including old furniture, hand carved doors, balconies and high ceilings.
Radio Ceylon and subsequently the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, the oldest radio station in South Asia, has recorded many programs here from their outside broadcast input in the 1950s and 1960s.
The Galle Face Green is administered and maintained by the Urban Development Authority of Sri Lanka (UDA).
